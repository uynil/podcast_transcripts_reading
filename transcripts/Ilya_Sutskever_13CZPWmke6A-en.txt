the following is a conversation with Elliot discover co founder and chief scientist of open ai one of the most cited computer scientists in history with over 165,000 citations and to me one of the most brilliant and insightful minds ever in the field of deep learning. There are very few people in this world who I would rather talk to and brainstorm with about deep learning intelligence and life in general than Ilya on and off the mic. This was an honor and a pleasure. This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic for everyone feeling the medical, psychological and financial burden of this crisis. I'm sending love your way, stay strong, we're in this together. We'll beat this thing. This is the artificial intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it. Subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars on apple podcast support on Patreon are simply connect with me on twitter. Elex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N. As usual I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

This show is presented by cash up the number one finance app in the app store when you get it. Used code Lex podcast. Cash up unless you send money to friends buy Bitcoin, invest in the stock market with as little as $1 since cash app allows you to buy Bitcoin. Let me mention that Cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money is fascinating. I recommend a cent of money as a great book on this history. Both the book and audiobook agree Debits and credits on Ledgers started around 30,000 years ago, The US dollar created over 200 years ago, a Bitcoin first decentralized Cryptocurrency released just over 10 years ago. So given that history, Cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development but it's still aiming to just my redefine the nature of money. So again, if you get cash out from the app store, google play and use the code lex podcast, You get $10 and cash up will also donate $10 to first an organization that is helping advance robotics and stem education for young people around the world. And now here's my conversation with Elia discover you were one of the three authors with Alex Kosowski Geoff Hinton of the famed Alex net paper that is arguably uh the paper that marked the big catalytic moment that launched the deep learning revolution at that time? Take us back to that time. What was your intuition about neural networks about the representation of power of neural networks And maybe you could mention how did that evolve over the next few years up to today, over the 10 years.

Ilya  00:03:10
Yeah, I can answer that question At some point in about 2010 and 2011, I connected to facts in my mind basically the realization was this at some point. We realize that we can train very large shouldn't, you know, they were tiny by today's standards, but large and deep neural networks and to end with back propagation at some point, different people obtain this result. I obtained this result. The first, the first moment in which I realized that deep neural networks are powerful was when James martin's invented the hazing free optimizer in 2010 and he trained a 10 layer neural network and to end without pre training from scratch. And when that happened, I thought this is it because if you can train a big neural network, a big neural network can represent very complicated function. Because if you have a neural network with 10 layers, it's as though you allow the human brain to run for some number of milliseconds, neuron firings are slow And so in maybe 100 milliseconds that your neurons only fired 10 times. So it's also kind of like 10 layers and in 100 milliseconds you can perfectly recognize any object. So I thought so I already had the idea then that we need to train a very big neural network on lots of supervised data and then it must succeed because we can find the best neural network. And then there's also a theory that if you have more data than parameters you want over fit today, we know that actually this theory is very incomplete and you want overfitting when you have less data than parameters, but definitely if you have more data than parameters you want over fit.

Lex  00:04:50
So the fact that, you know that works for heavily over Perma trist wasn't discouraging to you. So you you were thinking about the theory that the number of parameters, the fact there's a huge number of parameters is okay. It's gonna be okay. I

Ilya  00:05:03
mean, there was some evidence before that, it was okay. But the theory was most the theory was that if you had a big data set and a big mural native was going to work the over privatization just didn't really um, figure much as a problem. I thought, well, I'm just going to add some data augmentation. It's going to be okay.

Lex  00:05:17
So where was any doubt coming from?

Ilya  00:05:19
The main doubt was can we train a big, if we have enough computer training big enough neural net with back propagation, back propagation? I thought it would work. This image wasn't clear was whether there would be enough compute to get a very convincing result. And then at some point Alex kozinski wrote this insanely fast cuda kernels for training convolutional neural nets. That was bam, let's do this, let's get imagine that. And it's going to be the greatest thing

Lex  00:05:40
Was your intuition, most of your intuition from empirical results by you and by others. So like just actually demonstrating that a piece of program can train a 10 layer neural network or was there some pen and paper or marker and whiteboard thinking intuition Because you just connected a 10 layer large neural network to the brain. So you just mentioned the brain. So in your intuition about neural networks, does the human brain come into play as an intuition builder?

Ilya  00:06:10
Definitely. I mean, you know, you got to be precise with these analogies between your artificial neural networks in the brain, but There is no question that the brain is a huge source of intuition and inspiration for deep learning researchers since all the way from Rosenblatt in the 60s. Like if you look at the whole idea of a neural network is directly inspired by the brain, you had people like McCollum and Pitts who were saying, Hey, you got this new neurons in the brain and hey, we recently learned about the computer and automata, can we use some ideas from the computer and automata to design some kind of computational object that's going to be simple, computational and kind of like the brain. And they invented the neuron. So they were inspired by it back then, then you have the convolutional neural network from Fukushima and then later young Lakhan who said, hey, if you limit the receptive field of neural network is going to be especially suitable for images as it turned out to be true. So there was a sort of a very small number of examples where analogies to the brain were successful and I thought, well, probably an artificial neuron is not that different from the brain if you squint hard enough. So it's just assume it is and enroll with it.

Lex  00:07:17
So we're now at a time where deep learning is very successful. So let us squint less and say, let's open our eyes and say what to you is an interesting difference between the human brain. Now, I know you're probably not an expert, uh, neither in your scientists and your biologist, but loosely speaking, what's the difference between the human brain and artificial neural networks? That's interesting to you for the next decade or two?

Ilya  00:07:43
That's a good question to ask. What is in what is an interesting difference between the neurons between the brain and our artificial neural networks. So, I feel like today artificial neural networks, so we all agree that there are certain dimensions in which the human brain vastly outperforms our models. What I also think there are some ways in which artificial neural networks have a number of very important advantages of the brain. Looking at the advantages and disadvantages is a good way to figure out what is the important difference. So, the brain uses spikes, which may or may not be important.

Lex  00:08:17
Yes, a really interesting question. Do you think it's important or not? That's one big architectural difference between artificial neural networks and

Ilya  00:08:25
it's hard to tell. But my prior is not very high. And I can say why, you know, there are people who are interested in spiking neural networks and basically what they figured out is that they need to simulate the non spiking neural networks in spikes and that's how they're going to make economic them work. If you don't simulate the non spiking neural networks in spikes, it's not going to work. Because the question is, why should it work? And that connects the questions around back propagation and questions around deep learning. You got this giant neural network, Why should it work at all? Why should that learning rule work at all? It's not a self evident question, especially if you let's say if you were just starting in the field and you read the very early papers, you can say, hey, people are saying, let's build neural networks. That's a great idea because the brain is the neural network. So it would be useful to build neural networks. Now let's figure out how to train them.

It should be possible to train them probably. But how and so the big idea is the cost function. That's the big idea. The cost function is a way of measuring the performance of the system according to some measure. By the

Lex  00:09:32
way, that is a big actually, let me think is that is that uh, one a difficult idea to arrive at. And how big of an idea is that there's a single cost function. Sorry, let me take a pause, is supervised learning a difficult concept to come to.

Ilya  00:09:50
I don't know all concepts are very easy in

Lex  00:09:52
retrospect. Yeah, that's what it seems trivial now. But because because the reason I asked that and we'll talk about it, because is there other things, is there things that don't necessarily have a cost function? Maybe have many cost functions or maybe have dynamic cost functions or maybe a totally different kind of architectures? Because we have to think like that in order to arrive at something new. Right?

Ilya  00:10:15
So the only So the good examples of things which don't have clear cost functions against again, you have a game. So instead of thinking of a cost function where you want to optimize, but you know that you have an algorithm gradient descent, which will optimize the cost function. And then you can reason about the behavior system in terms of what it optimizes with. Again, you say I have a game and reason about the behavior of the system in terms of the equilibrium of the game. But it's all about coming up with these mathematical objects that help us reason about the behavioral system.

Lex  00:10:47
Right? That's really interesting. Yes. Again, it's the only way it's kind of a the cost function is emergent from the comparison.

Ilya  00:10:53
It's I don't I don't know if it has a cost function, I don't know if it's meaningful to talk about the cost function of. Again, it's kind of like the cost function of biological evolution of the cost function of the economy. It's you can talk about regions to which it can will go towards but I don't think, I don't think the cost function analogy is the most useful.

Lex  00:11:14
So evolution doesn't that's really interesting. So if evolution doesn't really have a cost function, like a cost function based on its something akin to our mathematical conception of a cost function, then do you think cost functions in deep learning are holding us back? Yeah. So you just kind of mentioned that cost function is a is a nice first profound idea. Do you think that's a good idea? Do you think it's an idea will go past? So self place starts to touch on that a little bit in reinforcement learning systems.

Ilya  00:11:48
That's right. Self playing. Also ideas around exploration where you're trying to take action that's present surprise a predictor. I am a big fan of course functions. I think those functions are great and they service really well. And I think that whenever we can do things, we call these cost functions, we should and you know, maybe there is a chance that we will come up with some yet another profound way of looking at things that will involve cost functions in a less central way. But I don't know, I think cost functions are I mean I would not bet against those functions.

Lex  00:12:20
Is there other things about the brain that pop into your mind that might be different and interesting for us to consider in designing artificial neural networks. So we talked about spiking a little bit.

Ilya  00:12:33
I mean, 11 thing which may potentially be useful. I think people neuroscientists figured out something about the learning rule of the brain. Or I'm talking about spike timing dependent plasticity. And it would be nice if some people were just study that in simulation.

Lex  00:12:45
Sorry, spike timing dependent plasticity. Yeah, that's just a

Ilya  00:12:48
STD. It's a particular learning rule that uses spike timing to figure out how to determine how to update the Synapses. So it's kind of like if the synapse fires into the neuron before the neuron fires, then it strengthen the synapse. And if the synapse fires into the neurons shortly after the neuron fired, then it becomes the synapse. Something along this line. I'm 90% sure it's right. So if I said something wrong here don't don't get too angry,

Lex  00:13:15
but you sounded brilliant while saying it. But the timing, that's one thing that's missing. The temporal dynamics is not captured. I think that's like a fundamental property of the brain is the timing of the of the signals

Ilya  00:13:30
were recorded neural networks.

Lex  00:13:32
But you think of that as I mean, that's a very crew simplified uh what's that called? There's a clock, I guess to uh recurrent neural networks. It this seems like the brain is the general of the continuous version of that. The generalization where all possible timings are possible And then within those timings is contained some information you think recurrent neural networks, there are currents in recurrent neural networks can capture the same kind of phenomena as the timing that seems to be important for the brain in the in the firing of neurons in the brain.

Ilya  00:14:12
I mean, I think I think recurrent recurrent neural networks are amazing and they can do I think they can do anything. We would want them to if you want a system to do right now. Recurrent neural networks have been superseded by transformers but maybe one day they'll make a comeback. Maybe it'll be back. We'll see.

Lex  00:14:32
Let me uh a small change and say, do you think they'll be back? So, so much of the breakthroughs recently that we'll talk about on uh natural language processing on language modeling has been with transformers that don't emphasize recurrence. Do you think recurrence will make a comeback?

Ilya  00:14:50
Well, some kind of recurrence I think very likely recurrent neural networks for process as there typically thought of for processing sequences? I think it's also possible.

Lex  00:15:01
What is to you? A recurrent neural network And generally speaking, I guess. What is the recurrent neural network?

Ilya  00:15:07
You have a neural network which maintains a high dimensional hidden state. And then when an observation arrives it updates its higher dimensional hidden state through its connections in some way.

Lex  00:15:20
So, do you think, you know that's what like expert systems did? Right, symbolic. Ai the knowledge based growing a knowledge base is maintaining a hidden state which is its knowledge base and it's growing it by some question process. Do you think of it more generally in that way? Or is it simply is it the more constrained form of of a hidden state with certain kind of gating units that we think of as today with L S D M S and that,

Ilya  00:15:51
I mean the hidden state is technically what you described there. The hidden state that goes inside the LSD em or they are running or something like this. But then what should be contained? You know, if you want to make the expert system analogy, I'm not, you could say that the knowledge story in the connections and then the short term processing is done in the in the hidden state.

Lex  00:16:13
Yes, could you say that? So I sort of do you think there's a future of building large scale knowledge bases within the neural networks? Definitely. So we're gonna pause in that confidence because I want to explore that. Let me zoom back out and ask, mm back to the history of image. Net neural networks have been around for many decades. As you mentioned, what do you think were the key ideas that led to their success, that image in that moment and beyond The success in the past 10 years.

Ilya  00:16:49
Okay, so the question is to make sure I didn't miss anything, the key ideas that led to the success of deep learning over the past 10 years.

Lex  00:16:56
Exactly. Even though the fundamental thing behind deep learning has been around for much longer.

Ilya  00:17:02
So, the key idea about Deep learning, or rather, the key fact about deplaning before deep Learning started to be successful is that it was underestimated people who worked in machine learning simply didn't think that new neurons could do much. People didn't believe that large neural networks could be trained. People thought that well, there was lots of, there was a lot of debate going on in machine learning about what are the right methods and so on, and people were arguing because there were no, there were no, there was no way to get hard facts and by that, I mean, there were no benchmarks which were truly hard, that if you do really well in them and you can say, look, here is my system, that's when you switch from, that's when this field becomes a little bit more of an engineering field. So, in terms of deep learning to answer the question directly, the ideas were all there. The thing that was missing was a lot of supervised data and a lot of compute, once you have a lot of civil rights data and a lot of compute, then there is a third thing which is needed as well. And that is conviction, conviction that if you take the right stuff, it already exists and apply and mixed with a lot of data and a lot of compute that it will in fact work. And so that was the missing piece. It was you had the you need the data, he needed to compute, which showed up in terms of gpu s and you needed the conviction to realize that you need to mix them together.

Lex  00:18:35
So that's really interesting. So I guess the presence of compute and the President's supervised data allowed the empirical evidence to do the convincing of the majority of the computer science community. So I guess there's a key moment with Jitendra Malik and uh Alex Alyosha Effros, who were very skeptical, right? And then there's a Geoffrey Hinton that was the opposite of skeptical and there was a convincing moment and I think emission had served as that moment and that represented this kind of where the big pillars of computer vision community, kind of, the wizards got together and then all of a sudden there was a shift and it's not enough for the ideas that I'll be there and the computer be there. It's for it to convince the cynicism that existed that that's interesting that people just didn't believe for a couple of decades.

Ilya  00:19:32
Yeah, Well, but it's more than that, it's kind of when put this way, it sounds like, well, you know, those silly people who didn't believe what we're what we're missing. But in reality things were confusing because neuron really did not work on anything and they were not the best method on pretty much anything as well. And it was pretty rational to say, yeah, this stuff doesn't have any traction. And that's why you need to have these very hard tasks which are which produced undeniable evidence and that's how we make progress and that's why the field is making progress today because we have these hard benchmarks which represent true progress and so and this is why we were able to avoid endless debate.

Lex  00:20:15
So incredibly you've contributed some of the biggest recent ideas in ai in computer vision language, natural language processing, reinforcement learning sort of everything in between? Maybe not Ganz is there? There may not be a topic you haven't touched. And of course, the fundamental science of deep learning. What is the difference to you between vision language and as in reinforcement learning action as learning problems. And what are the commonalities do you see them as all interconnected? Are they fundamentally different domains that require different

Ilya  00:20:52
approaches? Okay, that's a good question. Machine learning is a field with a lot of unity. A huge amount of unity.

Lex  00:21:01
What do you mean by unity? Like overlap of ideas

Ilya  00:21:05
overlap of ideas, overlap of principles. In fact, there is only one or two or three principles which are very, very simple and then they apply in almost the same way in almost the same way to the different modalities to the different problems. And that's why today when someone writes a paper on improvement, optimization of deep learning envision it improves the different NLP applications and it improves the different reinforcement learning applications, reinforcement learning. So I would say that computer vision and NLP are very similar to each other today. They differ in that they have slightly different architectures, we use transformers in NLP and use convolutional neural networks envision, but it's also possible that one day this will change, everything will be unified with a single architecture because if you go back a few years ago in natural language processing, there were a huge number of architecture for every different tiny problem had its own architecture today there's just one transformer for all those different tasks and if you go back in time even more you had even more and more fragmentation and every little problem in ai had its own little sub specialization and sub little set of collection of skills, people who would know how to engineer the features. Now it's all been subsumed by deplaning, we have this unification and so I expect vision to become unified with natural language as well or rather I didn't expect, I think it's possible. I don't want to be too sure because I think on the commercial, you know that is very competition. The efficient a rail is different. A real doesn't require slightly different techniques because you really do need to take action. You really do need to do something about exploration, your variance is much higher. But I think there's a lot of unity even there and I would expect for example that at some point there will be some broader unification between RL and supervised learning where somehow they are l will be making decisions to make the super fast, don't even go better and it will be I imagine one big black box and you just throw you know, you shovel shovel things into it and it just figures out what to do with it, whatever you shovel at it.

Lex  00:23:04
I mean reinforcement learning has some aspects of language and vision combined almost there's elements of a long term memory that you should be utilizing and there's elements of a really rich sensory space. So it seems like the It's like the Union of the two or something like that,

Ilya  00:23:25
I'd say something slightly differently. I'd say that reinforcement learning is neither, but it naturally interfaces and integrates with the two of them.

Lex  00:23:34
You think action is fundamentally different. So yeah, what is interesting about what is unique about policy of learning to act

Ilya  00:23:43
Also, one example, for instance is that when you learn to act your fundamentally in a non stationary world because as your actions change the things you see, start changing you you experience the world in a different way and this is not the case for the more traditional static problem, you have some distribution and just to play a model to that distribution. Mhm.

Lex  00:24:06
You think it's a fundamentally different problem or is it just a more difficult generally it's a generalization of the problem of understanding.

Ilya  00:24:13
I mean it's it's it's a question of definitions, almost there is a huge um you know, there's a huge amount of commonality for sure. You take gradients, you try, you take gradients, we try to approximate gradients in both cases and some in the case of reinforcement learning, you have some tools to reduce the variance of the gradients, you do that, there's lots of commonalities, the same neural net in both cases you compute the gradients, you apply adam in both cases, so I mean there's lots in common for sure, but there are some small differences which are not completely insignificant, it's really just a matter of your your point of view, what frame of reference, how much do you want to zoom in or out as you look at these problems,

Lex  00:24:54
which problem do you think it's harder? So people like Noam chomsky believes that language is fundamental to everything, so it underlies everything. Do you think language understanding is harder than visual scene understanding or vice versa?

Ilya  00:25:09
I think that asking if a problem is hard, is slightly wrong, I think the question is a little bit wrong and I want to explain why, So what does it mean for a problem to be hard?

Lex  00:25:21
Okay, the non interesting dumb answer to that is there is this a there's a benchmark and there's a human level performance on that benchmark and how as the effort required to reach the human level

Ilya  00:25:35
benchmark. So from the perspective of how much, until we get to human level

Lex  00:25:40
on a very good benchmark

Ilya  00:25:43
Yeah, I understand, I understand what you mean by that. So what I was going going to say that a lot of it depends on, you know, once you solve a problem it stops being hard and that's, that's always true and so, but something is hard or not, depends on what our tools can do today, so to say today, true human level language understanding and visual perception a hard in the sense that there is no way of solving the problem completely in the next three months. So I agree with that statement beyond that, I'm just, that would be my guess would be as good as yours, I don't

Lex  00:26:13
know. Okay, so you don't have a fundamental intuition about how hard language understanding

Ilya  00:26:19
is, I think I know I changed my mind, that's a language is probably going to be hard, I mean it depends on how you define it, I give you mean absolute top notch, 100% language understanding and go with language.

Lex  00:26:32
So, but

Ilya  00:26:33
then if I show you a piece of paper with letters on it, is that if you see what I mean? So you have a vision system, you say it's the best human level vision system, I show you I open a book and I'll show you letters we need to understand how these letters form into words and sentences and meaning. Is this part of the vision problem. Where does the vision and the language begin?

Lex  00:26:53
Yeah, so chomsky would say it starts at language. The vision is just a little example of the kind of a structure and you know, fundamental hierarchy of ideas that's already represented in our brain somehow that's represented through language. But where does vision stop the language begin? That's a really interesting ah question. Mhm. So one possibility is that it's impossible to achieve really deep understanding in either images or language without basically using the same kind of system. So you're going to get the other for free.

Ilya  00:27:38
I think I think it's pretty likely that yes, if we can get one with our machine gun is probably that good that we can get the other, but it's not 100, I'm not 100% sure. And also and I think a lot, a lot of it really does depend on your definitions

Lex  00:27:53
definitions of

Ilya  00:27:55
like perfect vision because you know, reading his vision but should it count?

Lex  00:28:01
Yeah. To me. So my definition is a system looked at an image and then a system looked at a piece of text and then told me something about that and I was really impressed.

Ilya  00:28:15
That's relative. You'll be impressed for half an hour and then you're gonna say, well, I mean all the systems do that. But here's the thing they don't do.

Lex  00:28:22
Yeah, but I don't have that with humans. Humans continue to impress

Ilya  00:28:25
me. Is that true?

Lex  00:28:27
Well the ones, okay so I'm a fan of monogamy. So I like the idea of marrying somebody being with them for several decades. So I I believe in the fact that yes it's possible to have somebody continuously giving you uh pleasurable, interesting, witty new ideas. Friends. Yeah. I think I think so. They continue to surprise you. The surprise it's uh you know that injection of randomness seems to be a it seems to be a nice source of Yeah continued Yeah. Yeah inspiration. Like the with the humor I think yeah that that that that would be it's a very subjective test but I think if you have enough humans in their own.

Ilya  00:29:15
Yeah I understand what you mean. Yeah. I feel like I misunderstood what you meant by impressing you. I thought you meant to impress you with its intelligence with how how how good valid understands and an image. I thought you meant something like I'm going to show you a really complicated image and it's going to get it right and you're gonna say wow that's really cool. Systems of you know January 2020 have not been doing

Lex  00:29:36
that now. I I think it all boils down to like the reason people click like on stuff on the internet which is like it makes them laugh so it's like humor or wit or insight.

Ilya  00:29:49
I'm sure we'll get get that as well.

Lex  00:29:52
So forgive the romanticized question but looking back to you, what is the most beautiful or surprising idea and deep learning or ai in general you've come across.

Ilya  00:30:03
So I think the most beautiful thing about deep learning is that it actually works. And I mean it because you got these ideas, you got a little neural network, you got the back propagation algorithm and then you've got some theories as to, you know, this is kind of like the brain. So maybe if you make it large, if you make the neural network large and you trained and a lot of data then it will do the same function of the brain does. And it turns out to be true. That's crazy. And now we just trained these neural networks and you make them larger and they keep getting better. And I find it unbelievable. I find it unbelievable that this holy I stuffed with neural networks works.

Lex  00:30:39
Have you built up an intuition of why are there a little bits and pieces of intuitions of insights of why this whole thing works?

Ilya  00:30:48
I mean, some definitely Well, we know that optimization we now have good we've take we've had lots of empirical, huge amounts of empirical reasons to believe that optimization should work on all most problems we care about.

Lex  00:31:04
Do you have insights of what? So you just said empirical evidence is most of your sort of empirical evidence kind of convinces you. It's like evolution is empirical, it shows you that look this evolutionary process seems to be a good way to design organisms that survive in their environment, but it doesn't really get you to the insides of how the whole thing works.

Ilya  00:31:31
I think it's a good analogy is physics. You know, how you say, hey, let's do some physics calculation and come up with some new physics theory and make some prediction. But then you've got around the experiment, you know, you gotta run the experiment. It's important. It's a bit of the same here except that maybe some sometimes the experiment came before the theory but it still is the case. You know, you have some data and you come up with some prediction you say, yeah, let's make a big neural network, let's train it. And it's going to work much better than anything before it. And it will in fact continue to get better as you make it larger. And it turns out to be true. That's that's amazing when theory is evaluated like this. You know, it's not a mathematical theory, it's more of a biological theory almost. So I think there are not terrible analogies between deep learning and biology.

I would say it's like the geometric mean of biology and physics. That's deep learning the geometric

Lex  00:32:18
mean of biology and physics. I think we're going to need a few hours throughout my head around that because just to find the geometric just to find the set of what biology represents.

Ilya  00:32:33
Biology in biology things are really complicated and there is a really, really, really hard to have good predictive theory in physics theories are too good in theory in physics people make this super precise theories which makes these amazing predictions and in machine learning we can in between

Lex  00:32:48
kind of in between. But it would be nice if machine learning somehow helped us discover the unification of the two as opposed to serve the in between. But you're right, that's you're you're kind of trying to juggle both. So do you think they're still beautiful and mysterious properties of neural networks that are yet to be discovered?

Ilya  00:33:07
Definitely. I think that we are still massively underestimating deploying.

Lex  00:33:12
What do you think? It will look like? Like what

Ilya  00:33:15
if I knew I would have done it.

Lex  00:33:17
So uh

Ilya  00:33:19
But if you look at all the progress in the past 10 years, I would say most of it, I would say there's been a few cases where some were things that felt like really new ideas showed up, but by and large it was every year we thought, okay, deployment goes this far. No, it actually goes further and then the next year. Okay, now now this is this is big deep learning. Pr really done, nope, goes further, just keeps going further each year. So that means that we keep underestimating you keep not understanding it as surprising properties all the time.

Lex  00:33:48
Do you think it's getting harder and harder

Ilya  00:33:50
to make progress. You need to make progress? It depends on what you mean. I think the field will continue to make very robust progress for quite a while. I think for individual researchers, especially people who are doing research, it can be harder because there is a very large number of researchers right now. I think that if you have a lot of compute then you can make a lot of very interesting discoveries. But then you have to deal with the challenge of managing the huge computer, huge, classic, huge computer cluster to run your experiments. It's little bit

Lex  00:34:19
harder. So I'm asking all these questions that nobody knows the answer to, but you're one of the smartest people I know, so we can keep asking The so let's imagine all the breaks that was, that happened in the next 30 years and deep learning. Do you think most of those breakthroughs can be done by one person with one computer in the space of breakthroughs, do you think compute will be uh compute and large efforts will be necessary.

Ilya  00:34:49
I mean, it can't be sure when you say one computer, you mean how large

Lex  00:34:55
Uh you're you're clever. I mean, 1, 1

Ilya  00:34:58
GPU I see, I think it's pretty unlikely. I think it's pretty unlikely. I think that there are many the stack of deep learning is starting to be quite deep if you look at it, you've got all the way from with the ideas the systems to build the data sets, the distributed programming, the building the actual cluster, the Gpu programming, putting it all together. So the stack is getting really deep and I think becomes, it can be quite hard for a single person to become to be world class in every single layer of the stack.

Lex  00:35:34
What about what like Vladimir, Vap Nick really insists on is taking em nist and trying to learn from very few examples. So being able to learn more efficiently, do you think that there'll be breakthroughs in that space that would may not need the huge compute?

Ilya  00:35:51
I think there will be a very, I think there will be a large number of bakers in general if you're not in a huge amount of compute. So maybe I should clarify that. I think that some breakthroughs will look quite a lot of compute and I think building systems which actually do things will require a huge amount of compute that one is pretty obvious if you want to do X and X requires a huge mural that you gotta get a huge year on that. But I think there will be lots of, I think there's lots of room for very important work being done by small groups and individuals.

Lex  00:36:22
Can you maybe sort of on the topic of the science of deep learning, talk about one of the recent papers that you've released a deep double descent were bigger models and more data hurt. I think it's really interesting paper, can you can describe the main idea and

Ilya  00:36:39
yeah, definitely. So what happened is that some, over over the years, some small number of researchers noticed that it is kind of weird that when you make the new electric large it works better and it seems to go in contradiction with statistical ideas. And then some people made an analysis showing that actually you got this double the sand bump and what we've done was to show that double descent occurs for pretty much all practical deep learning systems and that it will be also. So

Lex  00:37:05
can you step back um what's the X axis and the y axis of a double descent plot?

Ilya  00:37:12
Okay, great. So you can you can look, you can do things like you can take your neural network and you can start increasing its size slowly while keeping your data set fixed. So if you increase the size of the neurons work slowly and if you don't do early stopping, that's a pretty important detail. Then when the newest book is really small, you make it larger, you get a very rapid increase in performance. Then you continue to make it large and at some point performance will get worse And it gets and it gets the worst. Exacting at the point at which it achieves zero training here, precisely. zero training loss. And then as you make it large, it's tough to get better again and it's kind of counterintuitive because you'd expect deplaning phenomena to be monotonic. And it's hard to be sure what it means. But it also occurs in the case of linear classifiers. And the intuition basically boils down to the falling when you when you have a lot, when you have a large data set and a small model then small, tiny random. So basically what is overfitting?

Overfitting is when your model is somehow very sensitive to the small random an important stuff in your dataset in the training day, in the training data set precisely. So if you have a small model and you have a big data set and there may be some random thing, you know, some training cases are randomly in the dataset and others may not be there, but the small model, but the small model is kind of insensitive to this randomness because it's the same. You there is pretty much no uncertainty about the model when the day is that it's

Lex  00:38:54
large. So, okay, so at the very basic level to me, it is the most surprising thing that you'll networks don't over fit every time very quickly, uh, before ever being able to learn anything, the huge number of parameters.

Ilya  00:39:13
So here is, so there is one way, okay, so maybe let me try to give the explanation and maybe that will be that will work. So you've got a huge neural network, I suppose you've got him, you are, you have a huge neural network is a huge number of parameters. And now let's pretend everything is linear, which is not, let's just pretend then there is this big subspace. Bring your network achieve zero area. And as duty is going to find approximately the point radio, That's right. Approximately the point with the smallest norm in that subspace. And that can also be proven to be insensitive to the small randomness in the data when the dimensionality is high, But when the dimensionality of the data is equal to the dimensionality of the model, then there is 1-1 correspondence between all the datasets and the models. So, small changes in the dataset actually lead to large changes in the model and that's why performance gets worse. So this is the best explanation. More or less.

Lex  00:40:09
So then it would be good for the model to have more parameters. So, uh, to be bigger than the data.

Ilya  00:40:15
That's right. But only if you don't really stop. If you introduce early stopping regularization, you can make a double descent bump almost completely disappear. What is early stop? Early stopping is when you train your model and you monitor your just validation performance. And then if at some point validation performance starts to get worse. You say, okay, let's stop training, You're good, You're good, You're good enough.

Lex  00:40:36
So the magic happens after after that moment. So you don't want to do the early stopping

Ilya  00:40:41
well, if you don't do the early stop and you get this very you get a very pronounced double descent,

Lex  00:40:47
do you have any intuition why this happens

Ilya  00:40:50
double descent. Also stopping,

Lex  00:40:52
You know, the double descent. So

Ilya  00:40:53
yeah, so I try. Let's see, the intuition is basically is this that when the data set has as many degrees of freedom as the model, Then there is a 1-1 correspondence between them. And so small changes to the data set lead to noticeable changes in the model. So your model is very sensitive to all the randomness, it is unable to discard it. Whereas it turns out that when you have a lot more data than parameters or a lot more parameters than data, the resulting solution will be insensitive to small changes in the data set.

Lex  00:41:27
So it's able to that's nicely put, discard the small changes the

Ilya  00:41:32
parameters. That's exactly the the the spurious correlations. If you don't want

Lex  00:41:37
Geoff Hinton suggested we need to throw back propagation already kind of talked about this a little bit, but he suggested that we need to throw away back propagation and start over. I mean, of course some of that is a little bit wit and humor. But what do you think? What could be an alternative method of training neural networks?

Ilya  00:41:56
Well, the thing that he said precisely is that to the extent that you can't find back propagation in the brain. It's worth seeing if we can learn something from how the brain learns. But back propagation is very useful and we should keep using it.

Lex  00:42:09
Oh, you're saying that once we discovered the mechanism of learning in the brain or any aspects of that mechanism, we should also try to implement that in your networks.

Ilya  00:42:17
If it turns out that you can't find back propagation in the brain

Lex  00:42:20
if we can't find back propagation in the brain.

Ilya  00:42:25
Well,

Lex  00:42:26
so I guess your answer to that is back propagation is pretty damn useful. So why are we complaining?

Ilya  00:42:33
I mean, I I personally am a big fan of back propagation. I think it's a great algorithm because it solves an extremely fundamental problem which is finding a neural circuit subject to some constraints. And I don't see the problem going away. So that's why I I really I think it's pretty unlikely that we'll have anything which is going to be dramatically different. It could happen, but I wouldn't bet on it right now.

Lex  00:43:00
So let me ask the sort of big picture question, do you think, can do you think neural networks can be made to reason

Ilya  00:43:08
why not? Well, if you look, for example, at alpha go or alpha zero, The Neural Network of Alpha zero plays go. Which which we all agree is a game that requires reasoning Better than 99.9% of all humans, just the neural network without this search, just the neural network itself doesn't that give us an existence proof that neural networks can reason

Lex  00:43:34
to push back and disagree a little bit? We all agree that go is reasoning? I think I I agree. I don't think it's a trivial. So obviously reasoning like intelligence is uh is a loose gray area term a little bit maybe you disagree with that. But yes, I think it has some of the same elements of reasoning reasoning is almost like a kin to search. Right? There is a sequential element of stepwise consideration of possibilities and sort of building on top of those possibilities in a sequential manner until you arrive at some insight. So yeah, I guess plane goes kind of like that and when you have a single neuron network doing that without search, that's kind of like that. So there's an existent proof in a particular constrained environment that a process akin to what many people call reasoning exists, but more general kind of reasoning. So off the

Ilya  00:44:35
board, there is one other existence problem,

Lex  00:44:37
boy. Which

Ilya  00:44:38
one of us? Humans?

Lex  00:44:39
Yes. Okay, Alright. So do you think the

Ilya  00:44:44
architecture

Lex  00:44:46
that will allow neural networks? The reason will look similar to the neural network architectures we have today?

Ilya  00:44:55
I think it will, I think well, I don't want to make too overly definitive statements. I think it's definitely possible that the neural networks that will produce the reasoning breakthroughs of the future will be very similar to the architecture that exist today. Maybe a little bit more current, maybe a little bit deeper. But but these these new ones are so insanely powerful. Why wouldn't they be able to learn to reason? Humans can reason. So why can't neural networks

Lex  00:45:26
do you think the kind of stuff we've seen neural networks do is a kind of just weak reasoning. So it's not a fundamentally different process. Again, this is stuff we don't nobody knows the answer to.

Ilya  00:45:36
So when it comes to our neural networks, I would sing, which I would say is that neural networks are capable of reasoning. But if you train a neural network on a task which doesn't require reasoning, it's not going to reason. This is a well known effect where the neural network will solve exactly the you'll solve the problem that you pose in front of it in the easiest way possible.

Lex  00:46:01
Right. That takes us to the 2. 1. 1 of the brilliant sort of ways you describe neural networks, which is uh you've referred to neural networks as the search for small circuits and maybe general intelligence as the search for small programs, which I found is a metaphor. Very compelling. Can you elaborate on that difference?

Ilya  00:46:26
Yeah. So the thing which I said precisely was that if you can find the shortest program that outputs the data in your disposal, then you will be able to use it to make the best prediction possible. And that's a theoretical statement which can be proven mathematically. Now you can also prove mathematically that it is that finding the shortest program which generates some data is not it's not a computable operation. No, finite amount of computer can do this. So then with neural networks, neural networks are the next best stain that actually works in practice. We are not able to find the best the shortest program which generates our data, but we are able to find, you know, a small But now now that statement should be amended even a large circuit which fits our data in some way.

Lex  00:47:22
Well, I think what you meant by the small circuit is the smallest needed circuit. Well,

Ilya  00:47:27
the thing, the thing which I would change now back back then. I really have I haven't fully internalized over parameter. The over parameters results the things we know about other parameters, neural nets. Now, I would phrase it as a large circuit that whose weights contain a small amount of information, which I think is what's going on. If you imagine the training process of a neural network as you slowly transmit entropy from the data set to the parameters, then somehow the amount of information in the weights ends up being not very large. Which would explain why the general is so well,

Lex  00:48:02
so that's the large circuit might be one that's helpful for the regular for the generalization.

Ilya  00:48:08
Yes. Something this. Mhm.

Lex  00:48:11
But do you see there, do you see it important to be able to try to learn something like programs?

Ilya  00:48:19
I mean if we can definitely I think it's kind of the answer is kind of yes, if we can do it, we should do things that we can do it. It's the reason we are pushing on deep learning. The fundamental reason the there is the root cause is that we are able to train them. So in other words, training comes first, you've got our pillar which is the training pillar and now we're trying to contort our neural networks around the training pillar, we gotta stay trainable, this is an involved, this is an invariance, we cannot violate. And so

Lex  00:48:55
being trainable means starting from scratch knowing nothing. You can actually pretty quickly converge towards knowing a lot

Ilya  00:49:01
or even slowly, but it means that given the resources at your disposal, you can train the neural net and get it to achieve useful performance. Yeah, that's a pillar we can't move away from. That's right. Because if you can various, if you say, hey, let's find the shortest program or you can't do that. So it doesn't matter how useful that would be. We can do it. So you want,

Lex  00:49:25
so do you think you kind of mentioned that the neural networks are good at finding small circuits or large circuits? Do you think that the matter of finding small programs is just the data? No. So the sorry, not, not the size or capture the quality, the type of data sort of asked giving it programs

Ilya  00:49:45
well, I think the thing is that right now, finding there are no good presidents of people successfully finding programs really well. And so the way you find programs is you train a deep neural network to do it basically right, Which is which is the right way to go about it.

Lex  00:50:05
But there's not good uh illustrations

Ilya  00:50:07
that hasn't been done yet. But in principle it should be possible.

Lex  00:50:13
Can you elaborate a little bit? What's your insight in principle? And it put another way you don't see why it's not possible?

Ilya  00:50:20
Well, it's kind of like more, it's more a statement of I think that it's I think that it's unwise to bet against deep learning and if it's a if it's a cognitive function in humans seem to be able to do, then it doesn't take too long for some deep neural net to pop up that can do it too.

Lex  00:50:42
Yeah, I'm I'm I'm there with you. I can I've stopped betting against neural networks at this point because they continue to surprise us. What about long term memory? Can you all know, is have long term memory is something like knowledge basis. So being able to aggregate important information over long periods of time that would then serve as useful sort of representations of ST that you can make decisions by so you have a long term contacts based on what you making the decision.

Ilya  00:51:18
So in some sense, the parameters already do that. The parameters are an aggregation of the day of the neurons of the entirety of the new Orleans experience. And so they count as the long as long form long term knowledge. And people have trained to various neural nets to act as knowledge bases and investigated with invest people have investigated language models knowledge basis. So there's work, there's work there.

Lex  00:51:44
Yeah. But in some sense do you think in every sense do you think there's a it's it's all just a matter of coming up with a better mechanism of forgetting the useless stuff and remembering the useful stuff because right now, I mean there's not been mechanisms that do remember really long term information.

Ilya  00:52:03
What do you mean by that precisely

Lex  00:52:05
precisely? I like I like the word precisely. So I'm thinking of the kind of compression of information the knowledge bases represent sort of creating a now I apologize for my sort of human centric thinking about what knowledge is because neural networks aren't interpret herbal necessarily with the kind of knowledge they have discovered. But a good example for me is knowledge base is being able to build up over time. Something like the knowledge that Wikipedia represents. It's a really compressed structured uh knowledge base. Obviously not the actual Wikipedia or the language but like a semantic web, the dream that semantic web represented. So it's a really nice compressed knowledge base or something akin to that in the non interpret able sense as um neural networks would have

Ilya  00:53:03
Well the neural networks would be no interpreter but if you look at the rates but their output should be very interpret Herbal.

Lex  00:53:09
Okay, so how do you, how do you make very smart neural networks like language models interpret Herbal?

Ilya  00:53:15
Well you asked them to generate some text and the text will generally be interpreted. Ble

Lex  00:53:19
do you find that the epitome of interpret ability? Like can you do better? Like can you because you can't okay, I would like to know what does it know, what doesn't know. I would like the neural network to come up with examples where it's completely dumb and examples where it's completely brilliant and the only way I know how to do that now is to generate a lot of examples and use my human judgment but it would be nice if and you know had some aware self awareness about

Ilya  00:53:48
100%. I'm a big believer in self awareness and I think that I think I think neural net self awareness will allow for things like the capabilities like the ones you describe, like for them to know what they know and what they don't know and for them to know where to invest to increase their skills most optimally and to a question of interpret ability. There actually two answers to that question. One answer is you know, we have the neural net so we can analyze the neurons and we can try to understand what the different neurons and different layers mean and you can actually do that and opening has done some work on that but there is a different answer which is that I would say that the human centric answer what you say, you know you look at a human being you can't read how do you know what a human beings think and you ask them, you say hey what do you think about this, what you think about that and you get some answers.

Lex  00:54:40
The answers you get are sticky in the sense you already have a mental model, you already haven't. Yeah, I meant amount of the human being, you already have an understanding of like a a big conception of what of that human being, how they think, what they know, how they see the world and then everything you ask, you're adding on to that and that stickiness seems to be. That's one of the really interesting qualities of the human beings. That information is sticky. You don't, you seem to remember the useful stuff aggregated well and forget most of the information that's not useful that that process but that's also pretty similar to the process and neural networks do is just that neural networks so much crappy at this time. It doesn't seem to be fundamentally that different but just stick on reasoning for a little longer. He said why not? Why can't I reason what what's a good impressive feat benchmark to you of reasoning that you will be impressed by its new owners were able to do. Is that something you already have in mind.

Ilya  00:55:49
Well, I think writing writing really good code. I think proving really hard theorems solving open ended problems with out of the box solutions

Lex  00:56:02
and uh sort of theorem type mathematical problems.

Ilya  00:56:06
Yeah, I think those ones are very natural example as well. You know, if you can prove an unproven theory and then it's hard to argue don't reason. And so by the way, this comes back to the point about the hard results. You know, if you've got a heart, if you have machine learning deep learning as the field is very fortunate because we have the ability to sometimes produce these unambiguous results and when they happen, the debate changes, the conversation changes. It's a conversation. We have the ability to produce conversation changing results

Lex  00:56:36
conversation. And then of course, just like you said, people kind of take that for granted. Say that wasn't actually a hard problem.

Ilya  00:56:41
Well, I mean, at some point we'll probably run out of heart problems.

Lex  00:56:46
Yeah. That whole mortality thing is kind of kind of a sticky problem that we haven't quite figured out. Maybe we'll solve that one. I think one of the fascinating things in your entire body of work, but also the work that opening I recently one of the conversation changes has been in the world of language models. Can you briefly kinda try to describe the recent history of using neural networks in the domain of language and text?

Ilya  00:57:11
Well, there's been lots of history, I think, I think the element network was was a small, tiny recurrent network applied to language back in the 80s. So the history is really, you know, fairly long at least. And the thing that started the thing that changed the trajectory of neural networks and language is the thing that changed the trajectory of all the polonium that's data and compute. So suddenly you move from small language models which learn a little bit and with language models in particular you can, there's a very clear explanation for why they need to be large to be good because they're trying to predict the next word. So we don't we don't know anything. You'll notice very, very broad strokes, surface level patterns like sometimes there are characters and there is a space between those characters. You'll notice this pattern, you'll notice that sometimes there is a coma and then the next character is a capital letter. You'll notice that pattern eventually you may start to notice that there are certain words occur often you may notice that spellings are a thing, you may notice syntax and when you get really good at all these, you start to notice the semantics, you start to notice the facts but for that to happen. The language model needs to be larger.

Lex  00:58:28
That's let's linger on that because that's where you and Noam chomsky disagree. So you think we're actually taking incremental steps sort of larger network larger compute will be able to get to the semantics to be able to understand language without what norm likes to sort of think of as a fundamental understandings of the structure of language. Like uh imposing your theory of language onto the learning mechanism. So you're saying the learning, you can learn from raw data, the mechanism that underlies language.

Ilya  00:59:10
Well, I think it's pretty likely. But I also want to say that I don't really I know precisely what is what Chomsky means. When he talks about him, you said something about imposing your structural language. I'm not 100% sure what he means. But empirically it seems that when you inspect those large language models, they exhibit signs of understanding the semantics, whereas the smaller language models do not. We've seen that a few years ago when we did work on the sentiment neuron, we trained a small, you know, small shell STM to predict the next character in amazon reviews. And we noticed that when you increase the size of the L. S. D. M. From 500 LSD themselves to 4000 sdm cells, then one of the neurons starts to represent the sentiment of the article of story of their view and why is that sentiment is a pretty semantic attributes, not a syntactic attribute.

Lex  01:00:03
And for people who might not know, I don't know if that's a standard term, but sentiment is whether it's a positive or a negative

Ilya  01:00:08
review. That's right. This is the person happy with something, is the person unhappy with something. And so here we had a very clear evidence that a small neural net does not capture sentiment while a large neural net does. And why is that? Well, our theory is that at some point you run out of syntax the models, you start to go to focus on something else

Lex  01:00:27
and with size, you quickly run out of syntax the model and then you really start to focus on the semantics. This would be the idea.

Ilya  01:00:36
That's right. And so I don't I don't want to imply that our models have complete semantic understanding because that's not true, but they definitely are showing signs of semantic understanding, partial semantic understanding. But the smaller models do not show that low signs.

Lex  01:00:51
Can you take a step back and say? What is gpt 2? Which is one of the big language models. That was the conversation changed in the past couple of years?

Ilya  01:01:00
Yes, so gpt two is a transformer with 1.5 billion parameters that was trained on About 40 billion tokens of text which were obtained from web pages that were linked to from reddit articles with more than three up votes.

Lex  01:01:19
And what's the transformer?

Ilya  01:01:20
The transformer is the most important advance in neural network architectures in recent history.

Lex  01:01:26
What is attention? Maybe too because I think that's an interesting idea, not necessarily sort of technically speaking, but the idea of attention versus maybe what recurring

Ilya  01:01:37
neural networks represented. So the scene is the transformer is a combination of multiple ideas simultaneously, which attention is one? Do you think attention is the key? No, it's a key, but it's not the key. The transformer is successful because it is the simultaneous combination of multiple ideas. And if you were to remove either idea, it would be much less successful. So the transformer uses a lot of attention but attention existed for a few years, that can be the main innovation the transformer is designed in such a way that it runs really fast on the Gpu and that makes a huge amount of difference. This is one thing, the second thing is the transformer is not recurrent and that is really important too because it is more shallow and therefore much easier to optimize. So in other words, uses attention. It is, it is a really great fit to the Gpu and it is not recurring, so therefore less deep and easier to optimize and the combination of those factors make it successful. So now it makes it makes great use of your GPU, it allows you to achieve better results for the same amount of compute and that's why it's successful.

Lex  01:02:48
Were you surprised how well transformers worked And GTT two worked. So you worked on language, you've had a lot of great ideas before transformers came about in language. So you got to see the whole set of revolutions before and after. Were you surprised?

Ilya  01:03:04
Yeah, a little,

Lex  01:03:05
a little. Yeah,

Ilya  01:03:07
I mean it's hard it's hard to remember because you adapt really quickly. But it definitely was surprising. It definitely was. In fact, you know what? I'll retract my statement. It was it was pretty amazing. It was just amazing to see generate this text of this. And you know, you got to keep in mind that we've seen at that time, you've seen all this progress in Ganz in improving. You know, the samples produced by gangs were just amazing. You have these realistic faces but text hasn't really moved that much And suddenly we moved from you know, whatever gangs were in 2015 to the best, most amazing Ganz in one step and I was really stunning even though theory predicted. Yeah, you train a big language model. Of course you should get this.

But then to see it with your own eyes, that's something else.

Lex  01:03:51
And yet we adapt really quickly. And now there is uh sort of some cognitive scientists Write articles saying that GTT two models don't truly understand language. We adapt quickly to how amazing the fact that they're able to model the language so well is. So what do you think is the bar for? What for impressing us that it

Ilya  01:04:19
I don't know

Lex  01:04:20
do you think that bar will continuously be moved,

Ilya  01:04:23
definitely. I think when you start to see really dramatic economic impact, that's when I think that's in some sense, the next barrier because right now if you think about the work in ai it's really confusing. It's really hard to know what to make of all these advances. It's kind of like, okay, you got in advance and now you can do a lot more things and you've got another improvement and you got another cool demo at some point. I think people who are outside of Ai they can no longer distinguish this progress anymore. So

Lex  01:04:55
we were talking off line about translating Russian to english and how there's a lot of brilliant work in Russian that the rest of the world doesn't know about. That's true for chinese, it's true for a lot of for a lot of scientists and just artistic work in general. Do you think translation is the place where we're going to see sort of economic big impact?

Ilya  01:05:14
I don't know, I think, I think there is a huge number of public, I mean first of all, I would want to I want to point out the translation already today is huge. I think billions of people interact with big chunks of the internet primarily through translation. So translation is already huge and it's hugely hugely positive too. I think self driving is going to be hugely impactful and that's you know, it's unknown exactly when it happens. But again, I would I would not bet against, Deep learning. So I

Lex  01:05:44
so that's deep learning in general, but you

Ilya  01:05:47
keep learning for self driving.

Lex  01:05:48
Yes. Deep learning for self driving, but I was talking about sort of language

Ilya  01:05:51
models, just your beard off a little bit

Lex  01:05:54
just to check you're not seeing a connection between driving and

Ilya  01:05:57
language. No, no. Okay, alright. Both using neural nets,

Lex  01:06:00
there'll be a poetic connection. I think there might be some, like you said, there might be some kind of unification towards uh I kind of multi task transformers that can take on both language and vision tasks and be an interesting unification. Now, let's see, what can I ask about GPT two more. Um,

Ilya  01:06:21
it's simple, so not much to ask it, take it, take it take to transform you make it give it more data and suddenly it does all those amazing things.

Lex  01:06:29
One of the beautiful things is that GPT the transformers are fundamentally simple to explain to train. Yeah. Do you think bigger will continue to show better results in language?

Ilya  01:06:44
Probably

Lex  01:06:45
Sort of like what are the next steps of the GTT two, do you think?

Ilya  01:06:48
I mean for I think for for sure, seeing what larger versions can do is one direction also. I mean there are there are many questions, there's one question which I'm curious about next following. So right now GPT two. So we fitted all this data from the internet, which means that it needs to memorize all those random facts about everything in the internet and it would be nice if the model could somehow use its own intelligence to decide what data it wants to accept and what David wants to reject. Just like people, people don't learn all data indiscriminately. We are super selective about what we learn. And I think this kind of active learning I think would be very nice to have

Lex  01:07:31
Yeah. Listen, I love active learning. So let me ask, does the selection of data, can you just elaborate that a little bit more? Do you think the selection of data is like, I have this kind of sense that the optimization of how you select data. So the active learning process is going to be a place for a lot of breakthroughs even in your future because there hasn't been many breakthroughs there that are public. I feel like there might be private breakthroughs that companies keep to themselves because the fundamental problem has to be solved if you want to solve self driving, if you want to solve a particular task, what do you what do you think about the space in general?

Ilya  01:08:14
Yeah. So I think that for something like active learning or in fact for any kind of capability, like active learning, the thing that it really needs is a problem. It needs a problem that requires it it's very hard to do research about the capability if you don't have a task because then what's going to happen is that you will come up with an artificial task, get good results, but not really convinced anyone?

Lex  01:08:37
Right? Like we're now past the stage where getting uh result and am n'est some clever formulation remnants who will convince people?

Ilya  01:08:47
That's right. In fact, you could quite easily come up with a simple active line scheme on amnesty and get a 10 x speed up. But then so what and I think that with active learning, their needs, they need active learning will naturally arise as there are problems that require it pop up. That's how I would, that's my, my take on it.

Lex  01:09:09
There's another interesting thing that opened as brought up with GTT two, which is when you create a powerful artificial intelligence system and it was unclear what kind of detrimental once you release GPT two, what kind of detrimental effect will have because if you have a model that can generate a pretty realistic text, you can start to imagine that, you know, on the it would be used by bots and some some way that we can't even imagine. So like there's this nervousness about what is possible to do? So you did a really kind of brave and I think profound thing which just started a conversation about this. Like how do we release powerful artificial intelligence models, the public if we do it all, how do we privately discuss with other, even competitors about how we manage the use of the systems and so on. So from that, this whole experience, you've released a report on it. But in general are there any insights that you've gathered from just thinking about this, about how you release models like this?

Ilya  01:10:14
I mean I think that my take on this is that the field of AI has been in a state of childhood and now it's exiting that state and it's entering a state of maturity. What that means is that the idea is very successful and also very impactful and its impact is not only large but it's also growing. And so for that reason it seems wise to start thinking about the impact of our systems before we listen them maybe a little bit too soon rather than a little bit too late. And with the case of GPT two like I mentioned earlier, the results really were stunning And it seemed plausible. It didn't seem certain it's implausible that something like GTT two could easily use to reduce the cost of this information. And so there was a question of what's the best way to release it And staged release seem logical. A small model was released and there was time to see the many people use these models in lots of cool ways. There's been lots of really cool applications. There haven't been any negative application to we know of and so eventually it was released but also other people replicated similar models.

Lex  01:11:27
That's an interesting question though that we know of. So in your view, stage release as uh at least part of the answer to the question of how do we how what do we do once we create a system like this?

Ilya  01:11:42
It's part of the answer, yes.

Lex  01:11:44
Is there any other insights, like, say you don't want to release the model at all because it's useful to you for whatever the businesses,

Ilya  01:11:52
while there are plenty of people don't release models already.

Lex  01:11:55
Right, of course. But is there some moral ethical responsibility when you have a very powerful model to sort of communicate, like just as you said, when you had GPT two, it was unclear how much you could be used for misinformation. It's an open question and getting an answer to that might require that you talk to other really smart people that are outside uh outside your particular group. Have you please tell me there's some optimistic pathway for people across the world to collaborate on these kinds of cases, or is it still really difficult from from one company to talk to another company?

Ilya  01:12:36
So, it's definitely possible. It's definitely possible to discuss these kind of models with colleagues elsewhere and to get to get their take on what on what to do?

Lex  01:12:49
How hard is it though?

Ilya  01:12:50
I mean,

Lex  01:12:53
do you see that happening?

Ilya  01:12:54
I think that's that's a place where it's important to gradually build trust between companies because ultimately all the ai developers are building technology which is going to be increasingly more powerful. And so it's the way to think about it. Is that ultimately only together.

Lex  01:13:15
Yeah, it's uh I tend to believe in the better angels of our nature, but I do hope that that when you build a really powerful Ai system in a particular domain that you also think about the potential negative consequences of. Yeah. Yeah. It's an interesting and scary possibility. There will be a race for ai ai development that would push people to close that development and not share ideas with others.

Ilya  01:13:50
I don't love this. I've been in a pure academic for 10 years, I really like sharing ideas and it's fun, it's exciting. Mhm.

Lex  01:13:58
What do you think it takes to, let's talk about a G. I a little bit, what do you think it takes to build a system of human level intelligence? We talked about reasoning, we talked about a long term memory, but in general, what does it take? Do you think?

Ilya  01:14:10
Well, I can't be sure, but I think the deep learning plus maybe another small idea,

Lex  01:14:20
do you think self play will be involved sort of like you've spoken about the powerful mechanism self play, where systems learned by sort of exploring the world in a competitive setting against other entities that are similarly skilled as them and so incrementally improving this way? Do you think self play will be a component of building an A G. I. System.

Ilya  01:14:44
Yeah. So what I would say to build a G I I think it's going to be deep learning plus some ideas and I think self play will be one of those ideas. I think that that is a very self play has this amazing property that it can surprise us in truly novel ways. For example, like we I mean pretty much every self place system both our daughter bought. I don't know if opening, I had a release about multi agent where you had two little agents were playing hide and sick and of course also Alpha zero, they were all produced surprising behaviors. They all produce behaviors that we didn't expect their creative solutions to problems and that seems like an important part of a G that our systems don't exhibit routinely right now. And so that's why I like this area like this direction because of its ability to surprise us

Lex  01:15:44
to surprise us. And the system would surprise this

Ilya  01:15:47
fundamental. Yes. But and to be precise, not just not just a random surprise but to find a surprising solution to a problem. It's also useful right

Lex  01:15:56
now a lot of the self play mechanisms have been used in the game context or at least in the simulation context? Mm hmm. How much, how much, how far along the path to e G do you think will be done in simulation? How much faith promise do you have in simulation versus having to have a system that operates in the real world, whether it's the real world of digital, real world data or real world like actual physical world of robotics.

Ilya  01:16:30
I don't think it's an easy war. I think simulation is a tool and it helps it has certain strengths and certain weaknesses and we should use it.

Lex  01:16:38
Yeah. But okay. I understand that that's um that's true. But one of the criticisms of self play, one of the criticisms and reinforcement learning is one of the its current power. Its current results while amazing have been demonstrated in a simulated environments or very constrained physical environments. Do you think it's possible to escape them escape the simulated environments and be able to learn in non simulated environments? Or do you think it's possible to also just simulate in the photo realistic and physics realistic way the real world in a way that we can solve real problems with self play in simulation.

Ilya  01:17:23
So I think that's transferred from simulation to the real world is definitely possible and has been exhibited many times by many different groups. It's been especially successful. Envision also open Ai in the summer has demonstrated a robot hand which was trained entirely in simulation in a certain way that allowed for seem to real transfer to occur.

Lex  01:17:46
Is this for the Rubik's

Ilya  01:17:48
cube. That's right

Lex  01:17:49
and I wasn't aware that was trained in

Ilya  01:17:51
simulation was trained in simulation entirely.

Lex  01:17:54
Really. So it wasn't in the physics that the hand wasn't trained.

Ilya  01:17:57
No 100% of the training was done in simulation and the policy that was learned in simulation was trained to be very adaptive, so adaptive that when you transfer it, it could very quickly adapted the physical to the physical

Lex  01:18:10
world. So the kind of perturbations with giraffe or whatever the heck it was. Those were those part of the simulation.

Ilya  01:18:18
Well, the simulation was generally so the simulation was trained to be robust to many different things, but not the kind of perturbations we've had in the video. So it's never been trained with the glove. It's never been trained with uh a stuffed giraffe.

Lex  01:18:34
So in theory, these are novel

Ilya  01:18:35
probation, correct? It's not in theory in practice.

Lex  01:18:37
And that those are novels probation. Well, that's okay, that's a clean small scale but clean example of a transfer from the simulated world to the physical

Ilya  01:18:48
world. And I will also say that I expect the transfer capabilities of deep learning to increase in general and the better the transfer capabilities are, the more useful simulation will become. Because then you could take you could experience something in simulation and then learn a moral of the story which you could then carry with you to the real world, as humans do all the time in the play computer games. So

Lex  01:19:15
let me ask sort of an embodied question staying on a G for a sec. Do you think A. Js is still we need to have a body, we need to have some of those human elements of self awareness? Consciousness sort of fear of mortality sort of self preservation in the physical space which comes with having a body?

Ilya  01:19:37
I think having a body will be useful. I don't think it's necessary but I think it's very useful to have a body for sure. Because you can learn whole new, you can learn things which cannot be learned without a body. But at the same time I think that you can, if you don't have a body, you could compensate for it and still succeed. I think so. Yes. Well there is evidence for this for example, there are many people who were born deaf and blind and they were able to compensate for the lack of modalities. I'm thinking about Helen Keller specifically.

Lex  01:20:08
So even if you're not able to physically interact with the world and if you're not able to I mean, I actually was getting at maybe let me ask on the more particular, I'm not sure if it's connected to having a body or not, but the idea of consciousness and a more constrained version of that is self awareness. Do you think I need a system should have consciousness? It's what we can't define God, whatever the heck you think consciousness is.

Ilya  01:20:36
Yeah, hard question to answer. Given how hard is define it,

Lex  01:20:41
Do you think it's useful to think

Ilya  01:20:42
about? I mean, it's it's definitely interesting. It's fascinating. I think it's definitely possible that our assistance will be conscious

Lex  01:20:50
doing as an emergent thing that just comes from. Do you think consciousness could emerge from the representation that's stored within your networks? So like that it naturally just emerges when you become more and more you're able to represent more and more of the world.

Ilya  01:21:04
Well, it's I'd make the following argument which is humans are conscious and if you believe that artificial neural nets are sufficiently similar to the brain, then there should at least exist artificial neurons, we should be conscious to.

Lex  01:21:20
You're leaning on that existence proof pretty heavily. Okay.

Ilya  01:21:25
But that's that's the best answer I can

Lex  01:21:28
give. No, I I know I know, I know. Um there's still an open question if there's not some magic in the brain that we're not? I mean, I don't mean a non materialistic magic but that that the brain might be a lot more complicated and interesting that we give it credit for

Ilya  01:21:46
if that's the case then it should show up and at some point we will find out that we can continue to make progress. But I think I think it's unlikely.

Lex  01:21:55
So we talk about consciousness but let me talk about another poorly defined concept of intelligence. Again, we've talked about reasoning, we've talked about memory. What do you think it's a good test of intelligence for you? Are you impressed by the test that alan turing formulated with the imitation game of with natural language. Is there something in your mind that you will be deeply impressed by if a system was able to do,

Ilya  01:22:23
I mean lots of things. There's certain there's certain frontier, there is a certain frontier of capabilities today. Yeah and there exists things outside of the frontier and I would be impressed by any such thing for example, I would be impressed by a deep learning system which solves a very pedestrian pedestrian task like machine translation or computer vision task or something which never makes a mistake human wouldn't make under any circumstances. I think that is something which have not yet been demonstrated and I would find it very impressive.

Lex  01:22:59
Yeah, so right now they make mistakes in different, they might be more accurate in human beings but they still make a different set of mistakes.

Ilya  01:23:06
So my my I would guess a lot of the skepticism that some people have about deep learning is when they look at their mistakes and they say well those mistakes they make no sense. Like if you understood the concept you wouldn't make that mistake and I think that changing that would be would would would inspire me that would be yes, this is this is this is this is progress.

Lex  01:23:29
Yeah, that's that's a really nice way to put it. But I also just don't like that human instinct to criticize the model is not intelligent, that's the same instinct as we do when we criticize any group of creatures as the other because yeah, it's very possible that Gpt two is much smarter than human beings and many things.

Ilya  01:23:53
It's definitely true. It is a lot more breadth of knowledge.

Lex  01:23:56
Yes breadth of knowledge and even and even perhaps depth on certain topics.

Ilya  01:24:02
It's kind of hard to judge what depth means. But there's definitely a sense in which humans don't make mistakes that these models do.

Lex  01:24:11
The same is applied to autonomous vehicles. The same is probably going to continue being applied to a lot of artificial intelligence systems. We find this is the annoying. This is the process of in the 21st century. The process of analyzing the progress of Ai Is the search for one case where the system fails. You know big way where humans would not. And then many people writing articles about it and then broadly as as the public generally gets convinced that the system is not intelligent and we like pacify ourselves but I think it's not intelligent because of this one anecdotal case and this seems to continue happening.

Ilya  01:24:51
Yeah I mean there is truth to that there's people although I'm sure that plenty of people are also extremely impressed by the system that exists today. But I think this connects to the earlier point we discussed that it's just confusing to judge progress in Ai. Yeah and you know you have a new robot demonstrating something how impressed should you be. And I think that people will start to be impressed once a I started to really move the needle on the G. D. P.

Lex  01:25:17
So you're one of the people that might be able to create media system here Not you but you and open ai if you do create a system and you get to spend sort of the evening with it. Him her. What would you talk about Do you think

Ilya  01:25:34
the very first time first time? Well the first time I was just I would just ask all kinds of questions and try to make it to get it to make a mistake and that would be amazed that it doesn't make mistakes and just keep keep asking broad. Okay what kind

Lex  01:25:50
of questions do you think? Would they be factual or would they be personal emotional, psychological. What do you think?

Ilya  01:25:59
All of the above would you ask for advice definitely. I mean why why would I limit myself talking to a system like this?

Lex  01:26:09
Now again let me emphasize the fact that you truly are one of the people that might be in the room where this happens. So let me ask sort of a profound question about, I just talked to Stalin his story. I've been talking to a lot of people who are studying power. Abraham Lincoln said nearly all men can stand adversity. But if you want to test a man's character give him power I would say the power of the 21st century maybe the 22nd but hopefully the 21st would be the creation of an A. G. I. System and the people who have control direct possession and control of the system. So what do you think after spending that evening having a discussion with the A. G. I. System, what do you think you would do?

Ilya  01:27:03
Well the ideal world would like to imagine Is one where humanity. I like the board the board members of a company where they G. Is the Ceo. So it would be I would like the picture which I would imagine is you have some kind of different entities, different countries of cities and the people that leave their vote for what the A. G. That represents them should do an agency that represents them goes and does it? I think a picture like that I find very appealing. You can have multiple eight you would have an agent for a city for a country and there would be it would be trying to in effect take the democratic process to the next

Lex  01:27:52
level and the board can always fire the Ceo

Ilya  01:27:55
essentially press the reset button say re randomize the parameters.

Lex  01:27:59
But let me sort of that's actually okay that's a beautiful vision. I think as long as it's possible to to press the reset button. Do you think it will always be possible to press the reset?

Ilya  01:28:12
But so I think that it's definitely it's definitely really possible to build. So you're talking. So the question that I really understand from you is will will humans or humans people have control over the ai systems of the build. Yes. And my answer is it's definitely possible to build Ai systems which will want to be controlled by their humans.

Lex  01:28:38
Wow that's part of their. So it's not that just they can't help but be controlled but that's that's uh the they exist. One of the objectives of their existence is to be controlled in

Ilya  01:28:51
the same way that human parents generally want to help their Children. They want their Children to succeed. It's not a burden for them. They are excited to help Children to feed them and to address them and to take care of them. And I believe with high conviction that the same will be possible for an A. G. It will be possible to program an A. G. To design it in such a way that it will have a similar deep drive that it will be delighted to fulfill and the drive will be to help humans flourish.

Lex  01:29:28
But let me take a step back to that moment when you create the A. G. I. System. I think this is a really crucial moment. And between that moment and the democratic board members with the G. At the head, there has to be a relinquishing of power. So is George Washington despite all the bad things he did. One of the big things he did is you relinquish power here first of all, didn't want to be president and even when he became president, he gave he didn't keep just serving as most dictators do for indefinitely. Do you see yourself being able to relinquish control over any G. I. System, given how much power you can have over the world?

At first financial just make a lot of money right and then control by having possession of the GI system.

Ilya  01:30:24
I'd find it trivial to do that. I'd find it trivial to ruling this kind of part. I mean, you know, the kind of scenario you're describing sounds terrifying to me. That's all I would absolutely not want to be in that position.

Lex  01:30:38
Do you think you represent the majority or the minority of people in the eye community?

Ilya  01:30:46
While, I mean,

Lex  01:30:47
It's an open question, an important one. Are most people good is another way to ask

Ilya  01:30:52
it. So I don't know if most people are good, but I think that when it really counts, people can be better than we think

Lex  01:31:04
that's beautifully put. Yeah. Are there specific mechanism you can think of of aligning ai jen values to human values? Is that do you think about these problems of continued alignment as we develop the air systems?

Ilya  01:31:17
Yeah, definitely. In some sense, the kind of question which you are asking is so if you're able to translate the question to today's terms, it would be a question about how to get an RL agent that's optimizing a value function which itself is learned and if you look at humans, humans are like that because the reward function, the value function of humans is not external. It is internal. And there are definite ideas of how to train a value function, basically an objective, as objective as possible perception system that will be trained separately to recognize, to internalize human judgments on different situations and then that component wouldn't be integrated as the value as the base value function for some more capable aerial system. You could imagine a process like this. I'm not saying this is the process. I'm saying this is an example of the kind of thing you could do

Lex  01:32:24
so on that topic of the objective functions of human existence. What do you what do you think is the objective function? That simplicity in human existence? What's the meaning of

Ilya  01:32:35
life? Oh, mm hmm. I think the question is wrong in some way. I think that the question implies that the reason there is an objective answer which is an external answer. Your meaning of life is X. I think what's going on is that we exist. And that's amazing. And we should try to make the most of it and try to maximize our own value and enjoyment of are very short time while we do exist.

Lex  01:33:10
It's funny because action does require an objective function is definitely there in some form, but it's difficult to make it explicit and may be impossible to make it explicit, I guess is what you're getting at and that's an interesting fact of an RL environment?

Ilya  01:33:25
Well, what I was making a slightly different point is that humans want things and their wants create the drives that caused them to our wants. Our our objective functions are individual objective functions. We can later decided to we want to change that. What we wanted before is no longer good and you want something else.

Lex  01:33:44
But they're so dynamic there, there's got to be some underlying sort of Freud. There's things, there's like sexual stuff, there's people think it's the fear uh fear of death and there's also the desire for knowledge and you know, all these kinds of things appropriation. They're sort of all the evolutionary arguments, there seems to be there might be some kind of fundamental objective function from, from which everything else um emerges. But it seems because

Ilya  01:34:12
that's very I mean I think I think that probably is an evolutionary objective function which is to survive and procreate and make you make you student succeed. That would be my guess, but it doesn't give an answer to the question, what's the meaning of life? I think you can see how humans are part of this big process, This ancient process. We are we are they exist on a small planet and that's it. So given that we exist, try to make the most of it and try to enjoy more and suffer less as much as we can.

Lex  01:34:46
Let me ask too silly questions about life. one do you have regrets moments that if you went back you would do differently and two are there moments that you're especially proud of that made you truly happy

Ilya  01:35:01
so I can answer that. I can answer both questions. Of course there are, there's a huge number of choices and decisions that have made that with the benefit of hindsight, I wouldn't have made them and I do experience some regret but you know, I try to take solace in the knowledge that at the time I did the best they could and in terms of things that I'm proud of their, I'm very fortunate to have things I'm proud to have done things I'm proud of and they made me happy from for some time but I don't think that that is the source of happiness.
