This is a lex Friedman podcast and here's my conversation. Leon lagoon. Mm You co wrote the article Self supervised Learning. The Dark matter of Intelligence. Great title by the way, will be shown in Missouri. So let me ask, what is self supervised learning and why is it the dark matter of intelligence? I'll start by the dark matter part.

Speaker 2  00:07:14
Uh there is obviously a kind of learning that humans and animals are are doing that. We currently are not reproducing properly with machines with ai Right, so the most popular approaches to machine learning today are, or paradigms I should say are supervised learning and reinforcement learning and they are extremely inefficient supervised learning requires many samples for learning anything and reinforcement learning requires a ridiculously large number of trial and errors to for, you know, a system to run anything. Um and that's why we don't have self driving cars. That's a big leap

Speaker 1  00:07:55
from one to the other. Okay, so that to solve difficult problems, you have to have a lot of human annotation for supervised learning to work and to solve those difficult problems with reinforcement learning, you have to have some way to maybe simulate that problem such that you can do that large scale kind of learning that reinforcement learning requires,

Speaker 2  00:08:16
Right? So how is it that, you know, most teenagers can learn to drive a car in about 20 hours of practice, whereas even with millions of hours of simulated practice, self driving car, cat actually learned to drive itself properly. Um and so obviously we're missing something, right? And and it's quite obvious for a lot of people that, you know, the immediate response you get from many people is, well, you know, humans use their background knowledge to learn faster and they're right now, how was that background knowledge acquired? And that's the big question. So now you have to ask, you know, how do babies in the first few months of life learn how the world works mostly by observation, because they can hardly act in the world. Um and they've done an enormous amount of background knowledge about the world, that maybe the business of what we call common sense, this type of learning, it's not learning a task, it's not being reinforced for anything, It's just observing the world and figuring out how it works, building world models, learning world models, how do we do this and how do we reproduce this in machines. So self supervised learning is you know, one instance of one attempt trying to reproduce this kind of learning.

Speaker 1  00:09:34
Okay, So you're looking at just observation. So not even the interacting part of a child, It's just sitting there watching mom and dad walk around, pick up stuff all that. That's that's what you mean about background knowledge.

Speaker 2  00:09:47
Perhaps not even watching mom and dad just you know, watching the world go

Speaker 1  00:09:51
by just having eyes open or having eyes closed or the very act of opening and closing eyes that the world appears and disappears. All that basic information. And you're saying in in order to learn to drive like the reason humans are able to learn to drive quickly some faster than others is because of the background knowledge. They were able to watch cars operate in the world in the many years of leading up to it, the physics of basics objects and all that kind

Speaker 2  00:10:17
of. That's right. I mean the basic physics of objects you don't even know, you don't even need to know, you know how a car works right? Because that you can learn fairly quickly. I mean the example I use very often is your driving next to a cliff and you know in advance because of your you know, understanding of intuitive physics that if you turn the wheel to the right the car will via to the right were run off the cliff, fall off the cliff and nothing good will come out of this right. Um, but if you are a sort of, you know, tabula rasa reinforcement learning system that doesn't have a model of the world. Uh you have to repeat falling off this cliff thousands of times before you figure out it's a bad idea and then a few more 1000 times before you figure out how to not do it and then a few more million times before you figure out how to not do it in every situation you ever encounter.

Speaker 1  00:11:04
So self supervised learning still has to have some source of truth being told to it by somebody. So you have to figure out a way without human assistance or without significant amount of human assistance to get that truth from the world. So the mystery there is um how much signal is there? How much truth is there that the world gives you, whether it's the human world, like you watch Youtube or something like that or it's the more natural world. So how much signal is there?

Speaker 2  00:11:36
So here's the trick. There is way more signal in sort of a self supervised setting than there is in either supervised or reinforcement setting. And this is going to my, you know, an energy of the

Speaker 1  00:11:49
cake,

Speaker 2  00:11:51
you know, low cake as someone has called it where when you try to figure out how much information you ask the machine to predict and how much feedback you give the machine at every trial in reinforcement learning. You give the machine a single scalar, you tell the machine you did good, you did bad and you and you and you only tell this to the machine once in a while when I say you, it could be the universe telling the machine right? Um, but it's just one scalar. And so as a consequence, there is, you cannot possibly learn something very complicated without many, many, many trials where you get many, many feedbacks of this type supervised learning. You you give a few bits to the machine at every every sample, Let's say, your training image system, on you know recognizing images on image net, there is 1000 categories that a little less than 10 bits of information for example. But self supervised learning here is a setting, you ideally, we don't know how to do this yet, but ideally you would show machine a segment of video and then stop the video. And I asked the mission to predict what's going to happen next. And so you let the machine predict and then you let time go by and show the machine what actually happened and hope the machine will, you know, learn to do a better job at predicting next time around. There's a huge amount of information you give the machine because it's an entire video clip of uh, you know, the future after the video clip, you fed it in the first place.

Speaker 1  00:13:21
So both for language and provisions, there's a subtle seemingly trivial construction, but maybe that's representative of what is required to create intelligence, which is filling the gap so many gaps. It sounds dumb, but can you, it is possible you can solve all of intelligence in this way just for both language, just give a sentence and continue it or give a sentence and there's a gap in it. Uh some words blanked out and you fill in what words go there for vision, you get a sequence of images and predict what's going to happen next or you fill in what happened in between. Do you think it's possible that formulation alone as a signal for self supervised learning can solve intelligence for vision and language?

Speaker 2  00:14:15
I think that's our best shot at the moment. Um so whether this will take us all the way to, you know, human level intelligence or something or just cat level intelligence is not clear. But among all the possible approaches that people have proposed, I think it's our best shot. So I think this idea of an intelligent system filling in the blanks either, you know, predicting the future, inferring the past, filling in missing information. Uh you know, I'm currently feeling the blank of what is beyond your head and what you what your head looks like and you know, from, from the back because I have, you know, basic knowledge about how humans are made and I don't know if you're gonna, you know what you're gonna say at which point you're gonna speak, whether you're gonna move your head this way or that way, which way you're going to look. But I know you're not going to just dematerialized and reappear at three m down the whole, uh, you know, because I know what's possible and what's impossible according to into the physics. So you have

Speaker 1  00:15:13
a model of what's possible, It's impossible. And then you'd be very surprised if it happens and then you'll have to reconstruct your

Speaker 2  00:15:18
model, right? So that that's the model of the world, it's what tells you, you know, what fills in the blanks. So given your partial information about the state of the world, given by your perception, your your model of the world fills in the missing information. And that includes predicting the future, predicting the past and filling in things you don't immediately perceive.

Speaker 1  00:15:40
And that doesn't have to be purely generic vision or visual information or generic language. You can go to specifics like uh, predicting what control decisions you make when you're driving in a lane, you have a sequence of images from a vehicle and then you could, you have information if you recorded on video, where the car ended up going. So you can go back in time and predict where the car went based on the visual information that's very specific domain specific,

Speaker 2  00:16:11
right? But the question is whether we can come up with sort of a generic method for, you know, training machines to do this kind of prediction of filling in the blanks. So right now, uh, this type of approach has been unbelievably successful in the context of natural language processing. Every modern natural language processing is pre trained in self supervised manner To fill in the blanks to you, you show it to a sequence of words, you remove 10% of them and then you train from gigantic neural net to predict the words that are missing that. And once you've pretrained that network, you can use the internal representation learned by it as input to, you know, something that you trained supervised or whatever. Um, that's been incredibly successful. Not so successful in images, although it's making progress and it's based on sort of manual data augmentation, we can go into this later. But what has not been successful yet is training from video. So getting a machine to learn to represent the visual world, for example, by just watching video. Nobody has really succeeded in doing this.

Speaker 1  00:17:16
Okay, well, let's kind of give a high level overview what's the difference in uh, kind and in difficulty between vision and language. So, you said, people haven't been able to really kind of cracked the problem of vision open in terms of self supervised learning, but that may not be necessarily because it's fundamentally more difficult, maybe like when we're talking about achieving like passing the touring test in the full spirit of the turing test in language might be harder than vision. That's that's not obvious. So in your view, what? Which is harder or perhaps are they just the same problem when uh the father would get to solving each, the more we realize it's all the same thing. It's all the same cake.

Speaker 2  00:18:00
What I'm looking for are methods that make make them look essentially like the same cake. But currently they're not. And the main issue with learning war models or learning quality models is that uh the prediction is never a single thing because the world is not entirely predictable. It may be deterministic or stochastic. We can get into the philosophical discussion about it, but but even if it's deterministic, it's not entirely predictable. And so if I play a short video clip and then I asked you to predict what's going to happen next. There's many, many plausible continuations for that video clip and the number of continuation grows with the interval of time that you're asking the system to make a prediction for. And so one big question without supervision thing is how you represent this uncertainty. How you represent multiple discrete outcomes, how you represent a sort of continuum of possible outcomes, um etcetera. And you know, if you are sort of a classical machine learning person, you say, oh, you just represent the distribution right? And that we know how to do When we're predicting words. Missing words in the text because uh, you can have a neural net give a score for every word in the dictionary.

It's a big, you know, it's a big list of numbers, you know, maybe 100,000 or so. You can turn them into a probability distribution. That gives, that tells you when I say a sentence. You know, the, you know, the cat is chasing the blanket in the kitchen, you know, there are only a few words that make sense there. You know, it could be a mouse or it could be a laser spot or you know, something like that, right? And and if I, if I say the the blank is changing the blank in the savanna, you also have a bunch of possible options for those two words, right? Um, that, that because you have kind of a, you know, underlying reality that you can refer to to sort of fill in those blanks. Um, so you cannot say for sure in the savanna, if it's a, you know, a lion or a cheetah or whatever, you cannot know if it's a zebra or do or you know, whatever wildebeest the same thing. Um, but but you can represent the uncertainty by just a long list of numbers. Now, if I, if I do the same thing with video and I asked you to predict video clip, it's not a discrete set of potential frames. You have to have somewhere representing a sort of infinite number of plausible continuations of multiple frames in a, you know, high dimensional continuous space and we just have no idea how to do this properly.

Speaker 1  00:20:42
Uh finite high dimensional. So like

Speaker 2  00:20:45
you just find out high dimensional Yes,

Speaker 1  00:20:47
just like the words I try to get it to uh down to a small finance set of like under a million, something

Speaker 2  00:20:55
like that. Something like that. I

Speaker 1  00:20:56
mean it's kind of ridiculous that we're doing a distribution over every single possible award for language and it works. It feels like that's a really dumb way to do it. Um like there seems to there there seems to be like there should be some more compressed representation of the distribution over the

Speaker 2  00:21:16
words. You're right about that.

Speaker 1  00:21:17
And so do you have any interesting ideas about how to represent all the reality in a compressed way? So actually you can form a distribution

Speaker 2  00:21:25
over. That's one of the big questions, you know, How do how do you do that? Right? I mean, what's what's kind of, you know, another thing that that really is stupid about? Um I shouldn't say stupid, but like simplistic about current approaches to self supervised learning in in NLP and text, is that not only do you represent the giant distribution over words, but for multiple words that are missing those distributions are essentially independent of each other. Um and you know, you don't pay too much of a price for this. So you so you can't so the, you know, the system, you know, in the sentence that I gave earlier, if he gives a certain probability for a lion and cheetah and then a certain probability for uh you know, gazelle uh wildebeest and zebra. Ah those two probabilities are independent of each other. Ah And it's not the case that those things are independent lions actually attack like bigger animals than than cheetahs. So, you know, there's a huge independent hypothesis in this process which is not actually true. The reason for this is that we don't know how to represent uh properly distributions over community aerial sequences of symbols essentially when there, because the number grows exponentially with the length of the, of the symbols. And so we have to use tricks for this.

But um those techniques can, you know, get around like don't even deal with it. So, so the big question is like would there be some sort of abstract latent representation of text? They would say that, you know, when I when I switch lion for gazelle lion for cheetah, I also have to switch zebra for gazelle.

Speaker 1  00:23:07
So this independence assumption, let me throw some criticism at you that I often hear and see how you respond. So this kind of filling in the blanks, just statistics. You're not learning anything like the deep underlying concepts, you're just mimicking stuff from the past, you're not learning anything new such that you can use it to generalize about the world. Uh Or okay, let me just say the crude version which is is just statistics. It's not intelligence. What do you have to say to that? What do you usually say to that if you kind of hear this kind of thing,

Speaker 2  00:23:44
I don't get into those discussions because they are kind of pointless. Um So first of all, it's quite possible that intelligence is just statistics. It's just statistics of a particular kind. Yes. This

Speaker 1  00:23:55
is the philosophical question is it's kind of is intelligence, is it possible that intelligence is just statistics?

Speaker 2  00:24:03
But what kind of statistics? So if you are asking the question are the model of the world, the models of the world that we learn? Um do they have some notion of causality? Yes. So if the criticism comes from people who say, you know, a current machine learning system don't care about causality, which by the way is wrong. Uh You know, I agree with them. Yeah. You should you know, your model of the world should have your actions as one of your of the inputs and that will drive you to learn causal models of the world where you know what, you know what intervention in the world will cause what results or you can do this by observation of other agents acting in the world and and observing the effect other humans for example. So I think, you know, at some level description intelligence is just statistics. Uh but that doesn't mean you don't you don't you know, you won't have models that have you know deep mechanistic explanation for what goes on. The question is how do you learn them? That's that's the question I'm interested in.

Because you know a lot of people who actually voiced their criticism say that those mechanistic model has to have to come from someplace else. They have to come from human designers. They have to come from I don't know what and obviously we learn them uh or if we don't learn them as an individual nature, learn them for us using evolution. So regardless of what you think those processes have been learned somehow.

Speaker 1  00:25:32
So if you look at the the human brain just like when we humans introspect about how the brain works, it seems like when we think about what is intelligence, we think about the high level stuff like the models. We've constructed concepts like cognitive science like concepts of memory and reasoning module almost like these high level modules is there is this serve as a good analogy. Like are we ignoring the the dark matter? The basic low level mechanisms. Just like we ignore the way the operating system works. We're just using the the high level software. We're ignoring that at the low level, the neural network might be doing something like statistics like me. Sorry to use this word. Probably incorrectly included lee but doing this kind of fill in the gap kind of learning and just kind of updating the model constantly in order to be able to support the raw sensor information mission to predict it and adjust to the prediction when it's wrong. But like highland when we look at our brain at the high level, it feels like we're doing like we're playing chess, like we're like playing with high level concepts and we're stitching them together and we're putting them into long term memory. But really what's going underneath is something we're not able to introspect, which is this kind of simple, large neural network that's just filling in the gaps.

Speaker 2  00:26:57
Right? Well, okay, so there's a lot of questions. There are answers there. Ok, so first of all, there's a whole school of thought in neuroscience competition of neuroscience in particular. Um that likes the idea of predictive coding, which is really related to the idea I was talking about himself supervised learning. So everything is about prediction. The essence of intelligence is the ability to predict. And everything the brain does is trying to predict, predict everything from everything else. Okay, and then that's really sort of the underlying principle if you want. That uh self supervised learning is trying to kind of reproduce this idea of prediction as kind of an essential mechanism of task independent learning if you want. The next step is what kind of intelligence are you interested in reproducing and of course, you know, we all think about, you know trying to reproduce sort of you know high level cognitive processes in humans but like with machines were not even at the level of even reproducing the running processes in a in a cat brain um You know the most intelligent or intelligent systems don't don't have as much common sense as as a house cat. So how is it that cats learn?

And you know cats don't do a whole lot of reasoning. They certainly have causal models. They certainly have Because you know many cats can figure out like how they can act on the world to get what they want. Um they certainly have a fantastic model of intuitive physics, certainly of the dynamics of their own bodies but but also of praise and things like that. Right? So um they they're they're pretty smart, they only do this with about 800 million neurons. Um We are not anywhere close to reproducing this kind of thing. So to some extent I could I could say let's not even worry about like the high level cognition ah and kind of you know long term planning and reasoning that humans can do until we figure out like you know can we even reproduce what cats are doing now? That said this ability to learn world models I think is the key to the possibility of running machines. That can also reason. So whenever I give a talk I said there are there are three challenges in the three main challenges in machine learning. The first one is uh you know, getting machines to learn to represent the world.

Um and I'm proposing self supervised learning. Uh the second is getting machines to reason in ways that are compatible with essentially gradient based running because this is what deep learning is all about really. Um and the third one is something we have no idea how to solve it is, I have no idea to solve is uh can we get machines to learn hierarchical representations of action plans, you know, like, you know, we know how to train them to learn hierarchical representations of perception, you know, with conventional nets and things like that and transformers, but what about action plans? Can we get them to spontaneously loan good hierarchical representations of actions,

Speaker 1  00:29:52
also gradient based,

Speaker 2  00:29:54
Yeah, all of that, you know, needs to be somewhat differentiable so that you can apply sort of gradient based learning, which is really what deep learning is about.

Speaker 1  00:30:04
So it's background knowledge, ability to reason in a way, uh this differentiable that is somehow connected deeply integrated with that background knowledge or builds on top of that background knowledge and then given that background knowledge, be able to make hierarchical plans in the world.

Speaker 2  00:30:24
So if if you take classical optimal control, there's something classical optimal control called Uh model predictive control and it's, you know, it's been around since the early 60's Nasa uses that to compute trajectories of rockets. And the basic idea is that you have a predictive model of the rocket, let's say, or whatever system you are you intend to control which given the state of the system by time T. And given an action that you're taking the system. So for rocket to be thrust and you know, all the controls you can have uh it gives you the state of the system at time, T plus delta T. Right. So basically a differential equation, something like that. Um And if you have this model and you have this model in the form of some sort of neural net or some sort of set of formula that you can back propagate gradients through, you can do what's called model predictive control or great investment model, predictive control. So you have you can unroll that that model in time. You you you you feel it a hypothesized sequence of actions and then you have some objective function that measures how well at the end of the trajectory of the system has succeeded or matched what you wanted to do? Um you know, is it a robot harm as have you grasped the object you want to grasp if it's a rocket, you know, are you at the right place near the space station, things like that. Um and by back propagation through time. And again, this was invented in the 1960s by optimal control theories.

You can figure out what is the optimal sequence of actions that will uh you know, get my system to the best final state. So that's a form of reasoning. It's basically planning and a lot of planning systems in robotics are actually based on this. Uh and uh uh and you can think of this as a form of reasoning. So you know, to take the example of the teenager driving a car. Again, you have a pretty good dynamical model of the car, it doesn't need to be very accurate. But you know, again, that if you turn the wheel to the right and there is a cliff, you're gonna run off the cliff, right. You don't need to have a very accurate model to predict that and you can run this in your mind and decide not to do it for that reason because you can predict in advance that the result is going to be bad. So you can sort of imagine different scenarios and uh and then you know, employ or take the first step in the scenario that is most favorable and then repeat the process of planning. That's called receding horizon model predictive control. So even, you know, all those things have names, you know, going back, you know, decades. Um and so if you're not not the, you know, the classic optimal control, the model of the world is not generally learned.

Uh there's you know, sometimes a few parameters you have to identify that's called systems identification, but but generally the model is mostly deterministic and mostly built by hand. So the big question of ai I think the big challenge of Ai for the next decade is how do we get machines to learn predictive models of the world that deal with uncertainty and deal with the real world in all this complexity. So it's not just the trajectory of the rocket which you can reduce to first principles. It's not it's not even just the trajectory of a robot arm which again, you can model by, you know, careful mathematics but it's everything else everything we observe in the world. You know, people behavior um you know, physical systems that involve collective phenomena like water or or you know trees and you know, branches in a in a tree or something or or like complex things that you know, humans have no trouble developing abstract representations and predictive model for but we still don't know how to do with machines.

Speaker 1  00:34:03
Where do you put in these three? Maybe in the in the planning stages the game theoretic nature of this world where your actions not only respond to the dynamic nature of the world, the environment but also affected. So if there's other humans involved, is this is this Point # 4? Or is it somehow integrated into the hierarchical representation of action in your

Speaker 2  00:34:28
view? I think it's integrated. It's just um it's just that now your model of the world has to deal with. You know it just makes it more complicated right? The fact that humans are complicated and not easily predictable. That makes your model of the world much more complicated. That much more complicated.

Speaker 1  00:34:43
Well there's a chest. I mean I suppose chess as an analogy. So Monte Carlo tree search. I mean there's a I go you go I go you go like um Andre Capozzi recently gave a talk at M. I. T. About car doors. I think there's some machine learning too, but mostly car doors and there's a dynamic nature to the car. Like the person opening the door checking. I mean he wasn't talking about that, he was talking about the perception problem of what the ontology of what defines a corridor. This big philosophical question. But to me it was interesting because like it's obvious that the person opening the car doors that are trying to get out like here in new york trying to get out of the car, you're slowing down, it's going to signal something, you're speeding up is going to signal something and that's a dance.

It's a asynchronous chess game. I don't know. So it feels like um it's not just I mean I guess you can integrate all of them to one giant model. Like the entirety of that these little interactions because it's not as complicated as chest is just like a little dance. We do like a little dance together and then we figure it out.

Speaker 2  00:35:51
Well in some ways it's way more complicated than chess because because it's continuous, it's uncertain in a continuous manner. Uh doesn't

Speaker 1  00:36:00
feel more complicated,

Speaker 2  00:36:01
but it doesn't feel more complicated because that's what we're we've evolved to solve this kind of problem we have evolved to solve and so we're good at it because you know, nature has made us good at it. Nature has not made as good at chess. We completely suck at chess. Um in fact that's why we designed it as a game is to be challenging. And if there is something that, you know, recent progress in the chest and go has made us realize is that humans are really terrible at those things like really bad. You know, there was a story right before Alphago that you know, the best go players thought there were maybe two or three stones behind, you know, an ideal player that they would call God. In fact, no, they're like nine or 10 stones behind. I mean we're just bad. So we're not good at and it's because we have limited working memory. We know we're not very good at like doing this tree exploration that, you know, the computer is a much better um doing than we are, but we are much better at learning differentiable models of the world. I mean I said different people in a kind of, you know, I should say not differentiable in the sense that, you know, we went back up to it but in the sense that our brain has some mechanism for estimating gradients of of some kind and that's what you know makes us efficient. So if you have an agent that consists of a model of the world which you know in the human brain is basically the entire front half of your brain.

Um An objective function which uh inhuman in humans is a combination of two things. There is your sort of intrinsic motivation module which is on the basal ganglia. You know what the base of your brain that's the thing that measures pain and hunger and things like that, like immediate um you know feelings and emotions. Um And then there is you know the equivalent of what people in response to an inquiry critic which is a sort of module that predicts ahead what the outcome of a of the situation will be. And so it's it's not a cost function but it's sort of not an objective function but it's sort of you know train predictor of the ultimate objective function and that also is differentiable. And so if all of this is differentiable, your cost function, your your critic, your ah you know your your world model, then you can use gradient based type methods to do planning to do reasoning to do learning, you know to do all the things that we like an intelligent agent to do

Speaker 1  00:38:33
and the greeting based learning like what's your intuition that's probably at the core of what can solve intelligence? So you don't need like um logic based reasoning in your view?

Speaker 2  00:38:47
I don't know how to make logic based reasoning compatible with efficient learning. Okay. I mean there is a big question. Perhaps a philosophical question. I mean it's not that philosophical but uh that we can ask is is that you know, all the learning algorithms we know from engineering and computer science proceed by optimizing some objective function. Yeah. Right. Uh So one question we may ask is um is those learning in the brain minimize an objective function? It could be a you know, a composite of multiple objective functions but it's still an objective function. Uh Second if it does optimize the objective function, does it do does it do it by some sort of gradient estimation? You know it doesn't need to be backdrop but you know some way of estimating the gradient, inefficient manner whose complexity is on the same order of magnitude as you know, actually running the influence uh huh Because you can't afford to do things like you know perturbing a weight in your brain to figure out what the effect is and then sort of, you know, you can do sort of estimating gradient by perturbation, it's to me it seems very implausible that the brand uses some sort of um you know zeroth order black box gradient free optimization because it's so much less efficient than ingredient optimization? So it has to have a way of estimating ingredients,

Speaker 1  00:40:11
Is it possible that some kind of logic based reasoning emerges in pockets as a useful like you said, if the brain is an objective function, maybe it's a mechanism for creating objective functions. It's it's it's a mechanism for creating knowledge bases, for example, that can then be quarried, like maybe it's like an efficient representation of knowledge that's learned in a gradient based way or something like

Speaker 2  00:40:35
that. Well, so I think there is a lot of different types of intelligence. So first of all, I think the type of logical reasoning that we think about that we are, You know, maybe stemming from, you know, sort of classical ai of the 1970s and 80s. Um I think humans use that relatively rarely and are not particularly good at it,

Speaker 1  00:40:56
but we judge each other based on our ability to solve those rare problems. It's called like you

Speaker 2  00:41:03
test think so like I'm not very good at chess.

Speaker 1  00:41:07
Yes, I'm judging you this whole time because well we we

Speaker 2  00:41:11
actually with your with your heritage, I'm sure you're good at chess no

Speaker 1  00:41:15
stereotypes, not all stereotypes that you're

Speaker 2  00:41:18
well, I'm terrible at chess, so, you know, but I think perhaps another type of intelligence that I have is this uh you know, ability of sort of building models of the world from uh you know, reasoning obvious obviously, but also also data uh and those those models generally are more kind of an illogical right? So it's it's it's reasoning by simulation and that the analogy where you use one model to apply to a new situation, even though you've never seen that situation, you can sort of connected to a situation you've encountered before. Uh and and your reasoning is more, you know, akin to some sort of internal simulation. So you you're kind of simulating what's happening when you're building, I don't know, a box out of wood or something, right? You could have imagined in advance, like what would be the result of, you know, cutting the wood in this particular way? Are you going to use, you know, screws or nails or whatever? Um when you're interacting with someone, you also have a model of that person and and sort of interact with that person, you know, having this model in mind to kind of tell the person what you think is useful to them. So I think this disability to construct models of the world is basically the essence, the essence of intelligence and the ability to use it then too, plan actions that will fulfill particular criterion. Um of course is is necessary as well.

Speaker 1  00:42:47
So, I'm going to ask you a series of impossible questions as we keep asking as they have been doing so. So if that's the fundamental sort of dark matter of intelligence disability to form a background model, what's your intuition about how much knowledge is required, You know, I think dark matter, you could put a percentage of on it of of the composition of the universe and how much of it is dark matter, how much of his dark energy, how much information do you think is required to be a house cap? So you have to be able to when you see a box going it, when you see a human compute the most evil action, If there's a thing that's near an edge, you knock it off all of that. Plus the extra stuff you mentioned, which is a great self awareness of the physics of your of your own body in the in the world. How much knowledge is acquired do you think to solve it? I don't even know how to measure an answer

Speaker 2  00:43:46
to that question. I'm not sure how to measure it, but whatever it is, it fits in about About 800,000 neurons, 800 million neurons. Or

Speaker 1  00:43:55
the representation does

Speaker 2  00:43:57
everything all knowledge everything right? Um It was less than a billion. A dog is two billion, but a cat is less than one billion. And uh so multiply that by 2000 and you get the number of synapses. Uh and I think almost all of it is learned through this, you know, a sort of self supervised running, although, you know, I think a tiny sliver is learned through reinforcement running and certainly very little through, you know, classical supervisor running, although it's not even clear how supervised learning actually works in the, in the biological world. Um So I think almost all of it is is self supervision but it's driven by the sort of ingrained objective functions that a cat or human have at the base of the brain which kind of drives there um Their behavior. So you know nature tells us you're hungry, it doesn't tell us how to feed ourselves. That's that's something that the rest of our brain has to figure out right

Speaker 1  00:44:57
what's interesting because there might be more like deeper objective functions in allying the whole thing. So hyung hunger maybe some kind of. Now you go to like neurobiology, it might be just the brain ah trying to maintain homeostasis. So hunger is just one of the human perceivable symptoms of the brain being unhappy with the way things are currently because it could be just like one really dumb objective function at the core.

Speaker 2  00:45:26
But that's how that's how behavior is driven by the fact that you know, the orbital ganglia drivers to do things that are that are different from saying the wrong tong or certainly a cat is what makes you know, human nature versus orangutan nature versus get nature. So for example uh you know, our basal ganglia drives us to seek the company of other humans and that's because nature has figured out that we need to be social animals for our species to survive. And it's true of many primates, it's not true of orangutans, orangutans are solitary animals. Um They don't seek the company of others. In fact they avoid them. Uh In fact they scream at them when they come too close because they're territorial because for for their survival. You know, evolution has figured out that's the best thing. I mean there are occasionally socially of course for you know, um production and stuff like that. But um but but they're mostly solitary. So so all of those behaviors are not part of intelligence. You know, people say, oh you're never going to have intelligent machines because you know, human intelligence is social. But then you look at orangutan's, you look at octopus, octopus never know their parents.

They barely interact with any other. And they and they get to be really smart in less than less than a year, in like half a year. Um You know, in a year or they're adults in two years, the dead. So um there are things that we think as humans are intimately linked with intelligence, like social interaction like language. We think, I think we give way too much importance to language as a substrate of intelligence as humans because we think our reasoning is so linked with language.

Speaker 1  00:47:11
So for to solve the house cat intelligence problem, you think you could do it on a desert island. You could have, you could just have a cat sitting there. Um Looking at the ways that the ocean ways and figure out a lot of it out.

Speaker 2  00:47:27
It needs to have sort of you know the right set of drives to kind of you know get it to do the thing and learn the appropriate things right? But um like for example you know baby humans are are driven to learn to stand up and walk. Okay then let's start. That's kind of this desire is hardwired how to do it precisely is not that strong but the desire to move around and stand up. That's sort of for hardware, it's very simple to hardwire this kind of stuff.

Speaker 1  00:48:00
Oh like the desire to, well that's interesting. You're hardwired to want to walk that's not uh there's gotta be a deeper need for walking. I think it was probably socially imposed by society that you need to walk all the other bipedal.

Speaker 2  00:48:17
Make a lot of simple animals that you know it would probably work without every watching any other members of the species.

Speaker 1  00:48:25
It seems like a scary thing to have to do because you suck it by peter walking at first it seems crawling him is much safer, much more like why are you in a hurry? Well

Speaker 2  00:48:37
because because you have this thing that drives you to do it you know um Which is part of the human development is that understood actually what not entirely

Speaker 1  00:48:49
Know what is what's the reason to get on two ft. It's really hard. Like most animals don't get on two ft

Speaker 2  00:48:54
But they get on four ft. You know many mammals get on four ft very quickly, some of them extremely quickly.

Speaker 1  00:49:00
But I don't you know like from the last time I've interacted with the table that's much more stable than the thing than two legs. It's just a really hard problem.

Speaker 2  00:49:08
Yeah I mean birds have figured it out. It was two ft.

Speaker 1  00:49:11
Well technically we can go into ontology. They have four I guess they have two ft

Speaker 2  00:49:16
two ft, chickens. You know dinosaurs had two ft. Many of them

Speaker 1  00:49:20
allegedly I'm just now learning that T rex was eating grass not other animals. T rex might have been a friendly friendly pet. What do you think about uh I don't know if you looked at the test for general intelligence that francois chalet put together? I don't know if you've got a chance to look at that kind of thing. Like what what's your intuition about how to solve like an I. Q. Type of test?

Speaker 2  00:49:45
I don't know. I think it's so outside of my radar screen that it's not really relevant. I think in the short term. Well

Speaker 1  00:49:52
I guess one way to ask another way perhaps more closer to it. Do your work is like how do you solve em n'est with very little example data.

Speaker 2  00:50:04
That's right. And that's the answer to this Probably is not supervised running just learn to represent images and then learning uh you know to recognize handwritten digits on top of this will only require a few samples and we observe this in humans, right? You you show a young child a picture book with a couple of picture of an elephant and that's it. The child knows what an elephant is. And we we we see this today with practical systems that we, you know, we train image recognition systems with ah enormous amounts of of images. Either either completely self supervised or very weakly supervised. For example, you can train a neural net to predict whatever hashtag people type on instagram. Right? Then you can do this with billions of images because there's billions per day that are showing up. So the amount of training data there is essentially unlimited. And then you take the output representation, you know, a couple layers down from the output of what the system learn and feed this as input to a classifier for any object in the world that you want. And it works pretty well.

So that's transfer learning okay. Or weekly supervised transfer learning. Uh people are making very, very fast progress using self supervised learning for for with this kind of scenario as well? Um And you know, my guess is that that's that's gonna be the future

Speaker 1  00:51:24
for self supervised learning. How much cleaning do you think is needed for filtering um uh malicious signal or with a better term, but like a lot of people use hashtags on instagram to uh get like good sc oh that doesn't fully represent the contents of the image. Like they'll put a picture of a cat and hashtag it with like science awesome fun. I don't know all that. Why would you put science? That's not very good. S. C.

Speaker 2  00:51:54
O. The way the way my colleagues have worked on this project at at facebook now. Meta, meta II A few years ago dealt with this is that they only selected something like 17,000 tags that correspond to kind of physical things or or situations like you know that has some visual content. Um So you know you wouldn't have like hash TBT or anything like that

Speaker 1  00:52:19
also they keep a very select set of hashtag is what you're saying.

Speaker 2  00:52:23
Yeah. Okay. But it's still in still on the order of you know 10-20,000 so it's fairly large.

Speaker 1  00:52:29
Okay. Can you tell me about data augmentation? What the heck is data augmentation and how is it used? Maybe contrast of learning for for video? What are some cool ideas here?

Speaker 2  00:52:42
Right, so data augmentation, I mean first data augmentation, you know, is the idea of artificially increasing the size of your training set by destroying the Images that you have in ways that don't change the nature of the image. Right? So you take you you're doing this, you can do data augmentation honest and people have done this since the 1990s, right? You take a units digit and you shift it a little bit or you change the size or rotated skew it, you know, etcetera,

Speaker 1  00:53:09
noise,

Speaker 2  00:53:10
that noise etcetera. And it it works better if you're trying to supervise classify your with augmented data, you're going to get better results. Now. It's become really interesting over the last couple of years because a lot of self supervised learning techniques to pre train vision systems are based on data augmentation. And the the basic techniques is originally inspired by techniques that I worked on in the early 90s, and Geoff Hinton worked on. Also in the early 90s there were sort of parallel work I used to call this Siamese network. So basically you take uh two identical copies of the same network. They share the same weights and you show two different views of the same object. Either those two different views may have been obtained by data augmentation or maybe it's two different views of the same scene from a camera that you moved or at different times or something like that. Right? Or two pictures of the same person, things like that. And then you train this neural net, those two identical copies of this neural net to produce an output representation, a vector uh in such a way that the representation for those two images are as close to each other as possible as identical to each other as possible.

Right? Because you want the system to basically learn a function that will that will be in variant, that will not change whose output will not change when you transform those inputs in those in those particular ways. Right. Um so that's easy to do. What's complicated is how do you make sure that when you show two images that are different, the system will produce different things because if you don't have a specific provision for this, the system will just ignore the input. When you train it, it will end up ignoring the input and just produce a constant vector. That is the same for every input. Right, Let's go to collapse. Now, how do you avoid collapse? So these two ideas, One idea that I proposed in the early 90s with my colleagues at Bell Labs, John Bromley and a couple other people which we now call contrasted running, which is to have negative examples. Right? So you have pairs of images that you know, are different and you show them to the network and those two copies and then you push the two output vectors away from each other and they will eventually guarantee that things that are semantically similar, produced similar representations and things that are different, produce different representations.

We actually came up with this idea for a project of doing signature verification. So we would collect signature signatures from like multiple signatures on the same person and then train a neural net to produce the same representation. And then uh, you know, force the system to produce different representation from different signatures. Um this was actually the problem was proposed by people from what was a subsidiary of a TNT at the time called NCR And they were interested in storing representation of the signature on the 80 bytes of the magnetic strip of a credit card. So we came up with this idea of having a neural net with 80 outputs, you know that we would quantized on bites too so that we could include the

Speaker 1  00:56:15
and that included was then used to compare whether the signature matches or not.

Speaker 2  00:56:19
That's right. So then you would you sign it would run through the neural net and then you would compare the output bacteria to whatever is stored in your car. It actually worked, it worked but they ended up not using it because nobody cares actually. I mean the american, you know financial payment system is incredibly lax in that respect compared to europe

Speaker 1  00:56:39
with the signatures. What's the purpose of signatures anyway,

Speaker 2  00:56:42
this is everybody looks at them, nobody cares. It's Yeah, yeah. So so that that's contrasted running, right? So you need positive and negative pears. And the problem with that is that you know, even though I had the original paper on this, I'm actually not very positive about it because it doesn't work in high dimension if your presentation is high dimensional, there's just too many ways for two things to be different. And and so you would need lots and lots and lots of negative pairs. So there is a particular implementation of this which is relatively recent from actually the google toronto group where, you know, Geoff Hinton is the senior member there and it's called seem clear, S I M c CLR. And you know, basically a particular way of implementing this idea of contracting, running the particular objective function. Now, what I'm much more enthusiastic about these days is non contrasting methods. So other ways to guarantee that uh the representations will be different for different um different inputs. And it's actually based on an idea that Geoff Hinton proposed in the early 90s with a student at the time, so Becker and it's based on the idea of maximizing the mutual information between the outputs of the two systems. You only show positive pairs, you only show pairs of images that, you know, are somewhat similar and you train the two networks to be informative but also to be as informative of each other as possible.

So basically one representation has to be predictable from the other essentially. Uh And, you know, he proposed that idea had, you know, a couple of papers in the early nineties and then nothing was done about it for decades. And I kind of revived this idea together with my postdocs at at fair, um particularly postdoc called Stephanie who is now a junior professor in in Finland and University of Alto. Ah we came up with something called that we call below twins. And it's a particular way of maximizing the information content of of a vector, you know, using some hypothesis. And we have kind of another version of it that's more recent now called Victory V I C R e G. That that means variance and variance, variance, regularization. And I'm it's the thing I'm the most excited about in machine learning in the last 15 years. I mean I'm not, I'm really, really excited about this.

Speaker 1  00:59:06
What kind of data augmentation is useful for that non contrasted learning method? Are we talking about? Does that not matter that much or it seems like a very important part of the step? Yeah. How you generate the images that are similar but sufficiently different.

Speaker 2  00:59:21
Yeah, that's right. It's an important step and it's also an annoying step because you need to have that knowledge of what the documentation you can do that do not change the nature of the of the object.

Speaker 1  00:59:32
And so

Speaker 2  00:59:33
the standard scenario which, you know, a lot of people working in this area are using is you use the type of distortion. So so basically you do geometry distortion. So one basically just shifts the image a little bit is called crapping. Another one kind of changes the scale a little bit. Another one kind of rotate it. Another one changes the colors. You know, you can do a shift in color balance or something like that, um saturation. Another one sort of blurs it. Another one as noise. So you have like a catalog of kind of standard things and people try to use the same ones for different algorithms so that they can compare. Um but some algorithms, some self supervised algorithm actually can deal with much bigger, like more aggressive data augmentation and some don't. So that kinda makes the whole thing difficult, but but that's the kind of distortions we're talking about.

And and so you you you you trained with those distortions and then uh you you chop off the last layer, a couple layers of the of the network and you use the representation as input to a classifier. Are you trying to classifier um on the internet or whatever and measure the performance? And interestingly enough, the methods that are really good at eliminating the information that is irrelevant, which is the distortions between those images. Do a good job at eliminating it. And as a consequence you cannot use the representations in those systems for things like object detection and localization because that information is gone. So the type of the documentation you need to do depends on the task you want eventually the system to to solve and the type of the documentation standard documentation that we use today are only appropriate for object recognition or image classification. They're not appropriate for things like,

Speaker 1  01:01:19
can you help me out understand what, why the localization? So you're saying it's just not good at the negative uh like classifying the negative. So that's why it can't be used for the localization.

Speaker 2  01:01:29
No, it's just that you trained the system. You know, you you you give it an image and then you give it the same image shifted and scaled. You tell you that's the same image. So the system basically is trained to eliminate the information about position and size. So now now you want to use

Speaker 1  01:01:46
that, oh,

Speaker 2  01:01:47
like literally where an object is and what

Speaker 1  01:01:49
it's like a bounding box that they'd be able to actually okay, it can still find, it can still find the object in the image is just not very good at finding the exact boundaries of that object. Interesting, interesting. Which you know that that's an interesting sort of philosophical question. How important how important is object localization? Anyway, we're like obsessed by measuring like image segmentation, obsessed by measuring perfectly knowing the boundaries of objects when arguably that's not that essential to an understanding what are the contents of the scene?

Speaker 2  01:02:25
On the other hand, I think evolutionarily the first vision systems in animals were basically all about localization, very little about recognition. And in the human brain you have to separate pathways for recognizing the nature of the scene of an object and localizing objects. So, you use the first pathway called the ventral pathway for you. No telling what you're looking at the other path with the dorsal pathway is used for navigation for grasping for everything else. And you know, basically a lot of the things you need for survival are localization and detection

Speaker 1  01:03:03
is similarity learning or contrast of learning are these non contrast of methods the same as understanding something just because you know, distorted cat is the same as a non distorted cat. Does that mean you understand what it means to be a cat

Speaker 2  01:03:18
to some extent? I mean it's a superficial understanding obviously,

Speaker 1  01:03:22
but like what is the ceiling of this method do you think? Is this just one trick on the path to doing self supervised learning? Can we go really, really

Speaker 2  01:03:31
far? I think we can go really far. So if we figure out how to use techniques of that type perhaps very different. But you know, the signature to training system from from video to do video prediction essentially. Um I think we'll have a path um you know, towards uh you know, I wouldn't say unlimited but but a path towards some level of um you know, physical common sense in machines. And I also think that that ability to learn how the world works from a sort of high throughput channel, like like vision is a necessary step towards uh sort of real artificial intelligence. In other words, I believe in ground intelligence. I don't think we can train a machine to be intelligent purely from text because I think the amount of information about the world that's contained in text is tiny compared to what we need to know. So for example, let's and you know, people have attempted to do this for for 30 years, right? The side project and things like that. Right of basically kind of writing down all the facts that are known and hoping that some some sort of common sense will emerge. I think it's basically hopeless.

But let me take an example. You take an object. I described the situation to you. I take an object, I put it on the table and I pushed the table. It's completely obvious to you that the object will be pushed with the table, right? Because it's sitting on it. Um there's no text in the world, I believe that explains this. And so she trained a machine as powerful as it could be. You know, your gpt 5000 uh or whatever it is, it's never going to learn about this. Um that information is just is not present in any text.

Speaker 1  01:05:22
Well, the question like with the psych project, the dream I think is to have like, Like 10 million say facts like that that give you a head start. Like a parent guiding you now, we humans don't need a parent to tell us that the table move. Sorry, this smartphone will move with the table. But we get a lot of guidance in other ways. So it's possible that we can give

Speaker 2  01:05:49
it a quick shortcut. And what about cat? The cat knows that.

Speaker 1  01:05:52
No, but they evolved.

Speaker 2  01:05:54
So no, they learn like us

Speaker 1  01:05:57
the side of the physics of stuff. Well yeah, so you're saying it's uh you're putting a lot of intelligence onto the nurture side, not the nature because we seem to have you know, there's a very inefficient, arguably process of evolution that got us from bacteria to who we are today. I started at the bottom now we're here. So uh the question is how Okay, so the question is how fundamental is that the nature of the whole hardware? And then is there any way to shortcut it if it's fundamental if it's not if it's most of intelligence, most of the cool stuff we've been talking about is mostly nurture, mostly trained. We figured out by observing the world. We can form that big, beautiful sexy background model that you're talking about just by sitting there. Um then okay then you need to then like maybe um it is also supervised learning all the way down. So surprised learning

Speaker 2  01:07:00
whatever it is that makes uh you know human intelligence different from other animals which you know, a lot of people think is language and logical reasoning and this kind of stuff. It cannot be that complicated because it only popped up in the last million years. Yeah. Um you know it it it only involves you know less than 1% of our genome, right? Which is the difference between human genome and chimps or whatever. So uh it can be that complicated. You know, it can be that fundamental. I mean the most of the complicated stuff already existing cats and dogs and you know, certainly primates, non human primates.

Speaker 1  01:07:39
Yeah. That little thing with humans might be just uh something about social interaction and ability to maintain ideas across like a collective of people. It sounds very dramatic and very impressive but it probably isn't mechanistic lee speaking.

Speaker 2  01:07:55
It is, but we're not there yet. Like you know, we we have I mean this is number 634, you know, in the list of problems we have to solve.

Speaker 1  01:08:04
So the basic physics of the world is number one. What do you um just a quick tangent on data augmentation. So a lot of it is hard coated versus learned. Do you have any intuition that maybe there could be some weird data augmentation? Like generative type of data augmentation, like doing something weird to images, which then improves the similarity learning process. So not just kind of dumb, simple distortions, but buy you shaking your head just saying that even simple distortions are enough I

Speaker 2  01:08:43
think no, I think the augmentation is a temporary necessary evil. So what people are working on now is is two things. 1 is the type of self supervised learning like trying to translate the type of self supervised learning people using language translating these two images which is basically denouncing autoencoder method, right? So you you take an image, you you block, you mask some parts of it and then you train some giant neural net to reconstruct the parts that you are that are missing. And until very recently there was no there was no working methods for that. All the autoencoder type methods for images weren't producing very good representation, but there's a paper now coming out of the fair group at Emanuel Park that actually works very well. So that doesn't require the documentation that requires only masking.

Speaker 1  01:09:36
Okay, only masking for images. Uh Okay,

Speaker 2  01:09:40
right, so you masked part of the image and you train a system which, you know in this case is a transformer because you can you can transformer represents the images as non overlapping patches, so it's easy to mask patches and things like

Speaker 1  01:09:55
that. Okay then my question transfers to that problem then, masking, like why should the mask be square rectangle?

Speaker 2  01:10:01
So it doesn't matter, like, you know, I think we're gonna come up probably in the future with sort of, you know, ways to match that are, you know, kind of random essentially. I mean there are random already, but

Speaker 1  01:10:14
no, no, but like something that's challenging. Mhm. Like optimally challenging. So like, I mean maybe it's a metaphor that doesn't apply, but your it seems like there's a data augmentation or masking, there's an interact development with it, like you're almost like playing with an image and like it's like the way we play with an image in our minds

Speaker 2  01:10:37
but it's like drop out, it's like boston machine training you um you know every every every time you see a perceptive you also you can you can perturb it in some way. And then the principle of the training procedure is to minimize the difference of the output of the representation between the clean version and the corrupted version essentially. Right? And you you and you can do this in real time. Right? So you know, both the machine worked like this right? You you you show a perceptive, you tell the machine that's a good combination of activities or your input neurons uh and then you either uh let them go their merry way without clamping them to values. Or you only do this with the subset. And what you're doing is you're training the system so that the stable state of the entire network is the same. Regardless of whether it sees the entire input or whether it is only part of it. Um you know, the quarter method is basically the same thing. Right?

You're you're you're training a system to reproduce the input, the complete input and filling the blanks, regardless of which which parts are missing. And that's really the underlying principle. And you could imagine sort of even in the brain some sort of neural principle where you know neurons gonna oscillate, right? So they take their activity and then temporarily they kind of shut off to um you know force the rest of the system to basically reconstruct the input without their help. You know? And and and I mean you can imagine you know, process you know more or less biologically possible process something like that. And

Speaker 1  01:12:13
I guess with this diy noisy autoencoder and masking and data augmentation you don't have to worry about being super efficient. You can just do as much as you want and get better over time because I was thinking like you might want to be clever about the way you do all these procedures, you know? But that's only if it's somehow costly to do every iteration. But it's not really not really.

Speaker 2  01:12:41
Maybe and then there is you know the augmentation without explicit data augmentation. Is that augmentation by waiting? Which is you know the sort of video prediction. Um Your observing a video clip, observing the, you know, the continuation of the video clip. Try you try to learn a representation using the joint embedding architectures in such a way that the representation of the future clip is easily predictable from the representation of the of the observed clip.

Speaker 1  01:13:10
Do you think youtube has enough raw data from which to learn how to be a cat? I think so. So the the amount of data is not the constraint.

Speaker 2  01:13:23
No it would require some selection I think

Speaker 1  01:13:26
some

Speaker 2  01:13:26
some selection. So maybe the right type of data. You don't go down the

Speaker 1  01:13:31
rabbit hole of just cat videos that might you might need to watch some lectures or something. You

Speaker 2  01:13:36
know you wouldn't

Speaker 1  01:13:37
how metal would that be if it like watches lectures about intelligence and then learns watches your lectures and N. Y. U. And learns from that how to be intelligent.

Speaker 2  01:13:48
I don't think there'll be enough.

Speaker 1  01:13:49
Uh What's your do you find multimodal learning interesting. We've been talking about visual language like combining those together, maybe audio, all those

Speaker 2  01:13:59
kinds of things. There's a lot of things that I find interesting in the short term but are not addressing the important problem that I think are really kind of the big challenges. So I think you know, things like multitask learning, continual learning uh you know adversarial issues. I mean those have you know, great practical interests in the relatively short term possibly. But I don't think they're fundamental, you know, active learning even to some extent reinforcement learning. I think those things will become either obsolete or or useless or easy once we figured out how to do self supervised representation learning or or learning predictive models. And so I think that's what you know, the entire community should be focusing on at least people are interested in sort of fundamental questions or you know really kind of pushing the envelope of of ai towards the next the next stage. But of course there is like a huge amount of you know, very interesting work to do in sort of practical questions that have you know short term

Speaker 1  01:14:59
impact. Well, you

Speaker 2  01:15:00
know, it's

Speaker 1  01:15:01
it's difficult to talk about the the temporal scale because all of human civilization will eventually be destroyed because the sun will die out. And even if you're a musk is successful multi planetary colonization across the galaxy, eventually the entirety of it will just become a giant black holes and that's the universe. So, but but what I'm saying is then that logic can be used to say it's all meaningless. I'm saying all that to say that multitask learning might be your song, you're calling it practical or pragmatic or whatever, that might be the thing that achieves something very keen to intelligence while we're trying to solve them more. The general problem of self supervised learning of background knowledge. So the reason I bring that up, maybe one way to ask that question, I've been very impressed by what Tesla autopilot team is doing. I don't know if you've got any chance to glance at this particular one example of multitask learning, where they're literally taking the problem like, I don't know, Charles, Darwin start studying animals, they're studying the problem of driving and asking, okay, what are all the things you have to perceive and the way they're solving it is one, there's an ontology where you're bringing that to the table. So you're formulating a bunch of different tasks that's like over 100 tasks or something like that, that they're involved in driving and then they're deploying it and then getting data back from people that run to trouble and they're trying to figure out do we add task? Do we like we focus on each individual task separately? In fact, half. So the I would say I would classify Andre Karpati is talking to is so one was about doors and the other one about how much imagine that sucks, He kept going back and forth on those two topics, which image that sucks, meaning. You can't just use a single benchmark.

There's so like you you have to have like a giant suite of benchmarks to understand how well your your

Speaker 2  01:17:01
system actually agree with him. I mean he's uh he's very sensible guy. Um Now, okay, it's it's very clear that if you are faced with a an engineering problem that you need to solve in a relatively short time, particularly if you have it almost breathing down your neck, you're gonna have to take shortcuts, right? You you you might think about the fact that the right thing to do and the long term solution involves, you know, some fancy self provisioning, but you have, you know, you know, must present on your neck. Uh and you know, this involves uh you know, human lives and so you you have to basically just do the systematic engineering and you know, fine tuning and refinements and trial and error and and and all that stuff. Um There's nothing wrong with that, that's that's called engineering that's called, you know, putting technology out in the yeah in the world. Um, and you have to kind of are included before, before you do this, you know, um uh, so much for, you know, grand grand ideas and principles. Um, but you know, I'm placing myself sort of, you know, some, you know, upstream of this, you know, quite a bit of stream of this,

Speaker 1  01:18:17
you're play, don't think about platonic forms

Speaker 2  01:18:20
your platonic because eventually I want this stuff to get used. But uh, it's okay if it takes five or 10 years for the community to realize this is the right thing to do. I've done this before. It's been the case before that, you know, I've made that that case. I mean if you look back in the mid-2000 for example and you ask yourself the question, Okay, I want to recognize cars or faces or whatever. Ah, you know, I can use accomplished on that. So I can use the more conventional kind of computer vision techniques, you know, using interest point detectors or sift density features and you know, sticking an ECM on top at that time, the datasets were so small that those methods that use more hand engineering work better than complex. There's just not enough data for comments and comments were a little, a little sloth with the kind of hardware that was available at the time. And there was a sea change when uh, basically when, you know, datasets became bigger and and Gpus became available that that's what you know, the two of the main factors that basically made people change their, change their mind. Um and you can you can look at the history of like all sub branches of ai or pattern recognition and there is a similar trajectory followed by techniques where people start by you know, engineering the hell out of it. Um you know, be it optical character recognition, speech recognition, computer vision like the major recognition in general natural language understanding like you know, translation, things like that, right? You start to engineer the hell out of it.

Um you start to acquire all the knowledge, the prior knowledge, you know about image formation, about you know the shape of characters about you know morphological operations about like feature extraction, fourier transforms, you know, veronica moments, you know whatever, right? People have come up with thousands of ways of representing images so that they could be easily classified afterwards. Same for speech recognition right? There is, you know, two decades for people to figure out a good front end to pre process a speech signal so that you know, the information about what is being said is preserved. But most of the information about the identity of the speaker is gone. Um you know, castro coefficients or whatever. Right? Um And same for for text, right? You do named entity recognition and you parts and you you you do tagging of of of the parts of speech. And you know, you do this sort of tree representation of clauses and all that stuff right, before you can do anything. So that's how it starts, right? Just engineer the hell out of it.

And then you start having data and maybe you have more powerful computers, maybe, you know, something about statistical learning. So you start using machine learning and it's usually a small sliver on top of your kind of handcrafted system where, you know, you extract features by hand. Okay. And now, you know, nowadays, the standard way of doing this is that you train the entire thing and to end with the deep learning system and it learns its own features and and you know, speech recognition systems nowadays ocr systems are completely end to end. It's, you know, it's some giant neural net that takes raw wave forms and produces a sequence of characters coming out, and it's just a huge neural net, right? There is no, you know, Markov model, there's no language model that is explicit other than, you know, something that's ingrained in the in the sort of neural language model, if you want the same for translation, same for all kinds of stuff. So, you see this continuous evolution from, you know, less and less handcrafting and more and more learning. Um, and uh, I I think uh I mean it's between biology as well.

Speaker 1  01:22:11
So, I mean, we might disagree about this, maybe not in this one little piece at the end you mentioned active learning, it feels like active learning which is the selection of data and also the interactivity needs to be part of this general network that you cannot just be an observer to do self supervised learning. You have to well I don't self supervised learning is just a word, but I would whatever this giant stack of a neural network that's automatically learning, it feels my intuition is that you have to have a system whether it's a physical robot or a digital robot that's interacting with the world and doing so in a flawed way in improving over time in order to to form the self supervised learning well you can't just give it a giant sea of data.

Speaker 2  01:23:06
Okay? I agree. And I disagree. I agree in the sense that I think uh I agree. I agree in two ways. The first, the first way agree is that if you want and you certainly need a causal model of the world that allows you to predict the consequences of your actions. To train that model, you need to take actions right? You need to be able to act in the world and see the effect for you to be to learn

Speaker 1  01:23:29
causal models of the world. So that's not that's not obvious because you can observe others, you can observe others and you can infer that they're similar to you

Speaker 2  01:23:36
and then you can learn from that. Yeah. But then you have to kind of hardware, that part. Right? And you know, mirror neurons analyze stuff. Right? So, um, and it's not clear to me how you would do this in a machine. So, um um, so I think the the action part, it would be necessary for having causal models of the world. The second reason it may be necessary or at least more efficient is that ah active learning basically, you know, goes for the jugular of what you what you don't know right? Is, you know, obvious areas of uncertainty about your your world and about the how the world behaves. And you can resolve this uncertainty by systematic exploration of that part that you don't you don't know. And if you know that you don't know then, you know, it makes you curious.

You kind of look into situations that and uh, you know, across the animal world, different species at different levels of

Speaker 1  01:24:33
curiosity, right?

Speaker 2  01:24:35
Depending on how they're built, Right? So, you know, cats and rats are incredibly curious dogs. Not so much. I mean less.

Speaker 1  01:24:42
So it could be useful to have that kind of curiosity.

Speaker 2  01:24:45
So, it would be useful. But curiosity just makes the process faster. It doesn't make the process exists. Yeah. The so what process, what learning process is it that active learning makes more efficient? And I'm asking that first question, you know. Mm hmm. You know, we haven't answered that question yet. So, you know, I worry about active running once this question is,

Speaker 1  01:25:10
is the more fundamental question to ask. And if active learning or interaction increases the efficiency of the learning sometimes it becomes very different if the increase is several orders of magnitude right? Like that. But fundamentally is still the same thing and building up the intuition about how to, in a self supervised way to construct back our models efficient or inefficient is um, is the core problem. What do you think about Yasha banjos talking about consciousness and to all of these kinds of concepts?

Speaker 2  01:25:46
Okay. Um, I don't know what consciousness is but

Speaker 1  01:25:51
uh, it's a good opener

Speaker 2  01:25:53
and to some extent a lot of the things that are said about consciousness remind me of The questions people were asking themselves in the 18th century or 17th century when they discovered that uh, you know how the eye works and the fact that the image of the back of the eye was upside down right? Because you have a lens and and so on your retina. The image that forms is an image of the world but it's upside down. How is it that you see right side up and you know with what we know today in science, you know, we realized this question doesn't make any sense or is kind of ridiculous in some way. Right. So I think a lot of what is said about consciousness of that nature. Now that said there is a lot of really smart people that for for whom I have a lot of respect to talking about this topic, People like David Chalmers who is a colleague of mine at N. Y. U. Um I have kind of ah unorthodox folk uh speculative hypothesis about consciousness. So we're talking about the study of world model and I think you know, our entire prefrontal cortex basically is the engine for a world model, but when we are attending at a particular situation, we're focused on that situation, we basically cannot attend to anything else. And that it seems to suggest That we basically have only one world model engine prefrontal cortex, that engine is configurable to the situation at hand.

So we are building a box out of wood or we are you know driving down the highway playing chess. We we basically have a single model of the world that we can figure into the situation at hand, which is why we can only attend to one task at a time. Now, if there is a task that we do repeatedly um it goes from the sort of deliberate reasoning using model of the world and prediction and perhaps something like model predictive control which I was talking about earlier to something that is more subconscious that becomes automatic. So I don't know if you've ever played against the chess grandmaster. Uh you know, I get wiped out in you know 10 10 players right? Um and you know, I have to think about my move for you know like 15 minutes ah and the person in front of me, the grandmaster, you know would just like react within seconds, right? You know, he doesn't need to think about it. That's become part of subconscious because you know, it's basically just pattern recognition at this point. Um same, you know, you, the first few hours you drive a car, you're really attentive, you can't do anything else. And then after 2030 hours of practice, 50 hours, you know, it's subconscious, you can talk to the person next to you, you know, things like that, right? Unless the situation becomes unpredictable and then you have to start talking. So that suggests you only have one model in your head.

And it might suggest the idea that consciousness basically is the module that configures this world model of yours. You know, you need to have some sort of exec kind of overseer that configures your word model for the situation attend. And that that leads to kind of the really curious concept that consciousness is not a consequence of the power of our minds but of the limitation of our brains. Because we have only one world model, we have to be conscious if we had as many world models as there are situations we encounter, that we could do all of them simultaneously. And we wouldn't need this sort of executive control that we call consciousness.

Speaker 1  01:29:26
Yeah, interesting. And somehow, maybe that executive controller? I mean, the the hard problem of consciousness, there is some kind of chemicals in biology that's creating a feeling like it feels to experience some of these things. That's kind of like the hard question is, what the heck is that? And why is that useful? Maybe the more pragmatic question, why is it useful to feel like this is really you experiencing this versus just like information being processed? Um It could be just a very nice side effect of of the way we evolved. That's just very useful too to feel a sense of ownership, to the decisions you make, to the perceptions you make to the model, you're trying to maintain, like you own this thing and that's the only one you got and if you lose it, it was going to really suck. And so you should really send the bring some signals about it. What ideas do you believe might be true that most or at least many people disagree with you with, let's say in the space of machine learning.

Speaker 2  01:30:35
Well, it depends who you talk about. But I think so, certainly there is uh a bunch of people who are nativist right who think that a lot of the basic things about the world are kind of hard wired in our in our minds, um things like, you know, the world is three dimensional, for example, is that hardwired things like, you know, object permanence is something that we learn uh you know before the age of three months or so? Or or are we born with it? And there are you know very you know wide disagreement among the you know the cognitive scientists uh for this I think those things are actually very simple to learn. Um You know is it the case that the oriented edge detectors in V. One are learned or are they hard wired? I think they're learned. They might be learned before both because it's really easy to generate signals from the retina that I actually will train edge detectors. So um and again those are things that can be learned within minutes of opening your eyes, right? I mean Since the 1990s we have algorithms that can learn oriented as detector is completely unsupervised with the equivalent of a few minutes of real time. So so those things have to be learned. Um There's also those you know M.

I. T. Experiments where you kind of plugged the optical nerve on the auditory cortex of a baby ferret right? And that auditory cortex becoming visual cortex essentially. So you know clearly um there's running taking place there. Um So you know I think a lot of what people think are so basic that you need to be hardwired. I think a lot of those things are learned because they are easy to run,

Speaker 1  01:32:07
jesus. So you put a lot of value in the power of learning. What kind of things do you suspect might not be learned. Is there something that could not be learned?

Speaker 2  01:32:17
So your intrinsic drives are not learned? They there are the things that you know, make humans human or make, you know cats different from dogs, right? It's the busy drives that are kind of hardware already in our ganglia. Um I mean, there are people who are working on on this kind of stuff that's called intrinsic motivation in the context of reinforcement learning. So these are objective functions. Whether reward doesn't come from the external world, it's computed by your own brain. Your brain computes whether you're happy or not, right? It measures your degree of comfort or in comfort. And and because it's your brain computing this presumably knows also how to estimate gradients of this, right? So, um so it's easier to learn when you're objective is intrinsic. Um So that has to be hardwired the critic that makes long term prediction of the outcome, which is the eventual result of this that's learned. Ah And perception is learned and your model of the world is learned.

But let me take take an example of, you know why the critic and an example of father critic maybe learned right? If I if I come to you, you know, I reached across the table and I pinch your arm right, complete surprise for you. You would not have expected this

Speaker 1  01:33:38
was expecting that the whole time. But yes, right, let's say for the sake of the story

Speaker 2  01:33:42
um okay, your basal ganglia is going to light up because it's going to hurt, right? Um and now your model of the world includes the fact that I'm a pinch you if I approach my uh my

Speaker 1  01:33:56
don't trust

Speaker 2  01:33:57
humans, right? My hand to your arms, so if I try again, you're gonna recoil and that's your critic, your predictive, you know, your predictor of your ultimate pain system that predicts that something that is going to happen and you recoil to avoid it.

Speaker 1  01:34:15
So even that can be

Speaker 2  01:34:16
learned, that is learned, definitely. This is what allows you also to, you know, define some goals, right? So, um the fact that, you know, your school child, you wake up in the morning and you go to school and you know, um it's not because you necessarily like waking up early and going to school, but you know that there is a long term objective you're trying to optimize.

Speaker 1  01:34:37
So Ernest Becker, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the philosopher, he wrote the book, denial of death. And his idea is that one of the core motivations of human beings are terror of death. Our fear of death, that's what makes us unique from cats, Cats are just surviving. They do not have a deep under like cognizance introspection that over the horizon is the end. And he says that, I mean there's a terror management theory, that's just all these psychological experiments that show basically this idea that all of human civilization, everything we create is kind of trying to forget if even for a brief moment that we're going to die, when when do you think humans understand that they're going to die? Is it learned early on? Also like,

Speaker 2  01:35:31
I don't know to at what point, I mean, it's a, it's a question like, you know, at what point do you realize that you know what this really is? And I think most people don't actually realize what this is right? I mean, most people believe that you go to heaven or something, right?

Speaker 1  01:35:43
So to push back on that, what Ernest Becker says and um Sheldon Solomon, all of those folks and I find those ideas a little bit compelling is that there is moments in life early in life, a lot of this fun happens early in life when you are when you do deeply experience the terror of this realization and all the things you think about, about religion, all those kinds of things that we kind of think about more like teenage years and later we're talking about way

Speaker 2  01:36:13
Earlier. No, it's like seven or 8 years or something like that. You

Speaker 1  01:36:16
realize holy crap. This is uh like the mystery, the terror, like it's almost like you're a little pray a little baby deer sitting in the darkness of the jungle of the woods looking all around you, there's darkness full of terror. I mean that's that realization says, okay, I'm gonna go go back in the comfort of my mind where there's a will, there is a deep meaning where there is a maybe like pretend I'm immortal and however way however kind of idea I can construct to help me understand that I'm immortal, religion helps with that. You can, you can delude yourself in all kinds of ways. Like lose yourself in the business of each day, have little goals in mind, all those kinds of things to think that's going to go on forever and you kind of know you're gonna die. Yeah, it's gonna be sad. But you don't really understand that you're going to die. And so that's that's their idea. And if I find that compelling because it does seem to be a core unique aspect of human nature that we're able to think that we're going, we're able to really understand that this life is finite. That seems important.

Speaker 2  01:37:22
There's, there's a bunch of different things there. So, first of all, I don't think there is a qualitative difference between between us and cats in the term. I think the difference is that we just have a better long term, the ability to predict, you know, in the long term. And so we have a better understanding of other world works. So we have a better understanding of, you know, Finance Minister of life and things like

Speaker 1  01:37:42
that. So we have a better planning engine than cats.

Speaker 2  01:37:45
Yeah, but

Speaker 1  01:37:47
what's the motivation for we're planning?

Speaker 2  01:37:50
I think it's just a side effect that the fact that we have just a better planning engine because it makes us, as I said, you know, the essence of intelligence is the ability to predict. And so the because we're smarter as a side effect. We also have this ability to kind of make predictions about our own uh future existence or lack thereof. Um You say religion helps with that. I think religion hurts actually. Um it makes people worry about like, you know what's going to happen after their death etcetera. If you believe that, you know, you just don't exist after death. Like you know, it solves completely the property. At least

Speaker 1  01:38:24
you're saying if you don't believe in God, you don't worry about what happens after death.

Speaker 2  01:38:30
I don't know you want to worry about about you know, this life because that's the only one you have.

Speaker 1  01:38:36
I think it's well, I don't I don't know if I were to say what Ernest Becker says and I would say I agree with him more. The knot is you do deeply worry uh if you if you believe there's no God, there's still a deep worry like of the mystery of it all. Like how does that make any sense that it just ends. I don't think we can truly understand but this right? I mean so much of our life. The consciousness, the ego is invested in this in this being and then

Speaker 2  01:39:09
science keeps bringing humanity down from its pedestal. Yeah, but that's just another that's another example of it.

Speaker 1  01:39:16
That's wonderful. But for us, individual humans, we don't like to be brought down from the pedestal you're saying like what? But see you're fine with it because well, so what Ernest Becker would say is you're fine with it because that's just a more peaceful existence for you. But you're not really fine. You're hiding from. In fact, some of the people that experienced the deepest trauma uh earlier in life, they often before they seek extensive therapy will say I'm fine. It's like when you talk to people who are truly angry, how are you doing? I'm fine. The question is, what's going on?

Speaker 2  01:39:49
I had a near death experience. I had a very bad motorbike accident when I was 17. So, but that didn't have any impact on my reflection on that topic.

Speaker 1  01:40:02
So I'm basically just playing a bit of does afghan pushing back on wondering, is it truly possible to accept death? And the flip side? That's more interesting. I think for a I and robotics is how important is it to have this is one of the suite of motivations is to uh not just avoid falling off the roof or something like that. But ponder the the end of the ride. If you listen to the stoics, it's a it's a great motivator, It adds a sense of urgency. So maybe to truly fear death or be cognizant of it might give a deeper meaning and urgency to the moment to live fully.

Speaker 2  01:40:50
Maybe maybe maybe I don't disagree with that. I mean, I think what what it is me here is uh, you know, knowing more about about human nature. I mean I think human nature and human intelligence is a big mystery, is a scientific mystery in addition to, you know, philosophical and etcetera. But you know, I'm a true believer in science. So, um, and and and I do have kind of a belief that for complex systems like like the brain and the mind. The way to I understand it is try to reproduce it with, you know, artifacts that you build because you know what's essential to it when you try to build it, you know, the same way. Um, I've used this analogy before with you, I believe the same way we we only started to understand aerodynamics when we started building airplanes and that helped us understand how birds fly. You know, So I think there's kind of a similar process here where we don't have a theory of a full theory of intelligence but building intelligent artifacts will help us perhaps develop some, you know, underlying theory that encompasses not just artificial implements but also human and biological intelligence in general.

Speaker 1  01:42:05
So you're an interesting person to ask this question about sort of all kinds of different other intelligent entities or intelligences. What are your thoughts about kind of like the touring or the chinese room question if we create an Ai system that exhibits a lot of properties of intelligence and consciousness, how comfortable are you thinking of that entity as intelligent or conscious? So you're trying to build now systems that have intelligence and there's metrics about their performance but that metric is external. Okay, so how are you, are you okay calling a thing intelligent or are you going to be like most humans and be once again unhappy to be brought down from the pedestal of consciousness slash intelligence?

Speaker 2  01:42:56
No, I'll be very happy to understand uh more about human nature, human mind and human intelligence through the construction of machines that have similar abilities. And If the consequence of this is to bring down humanity one notch down from it's already located little, I'm just fine with it, that's just the reality of life. Um So I'm fine with that. Now you're asking me about things that opinions I have that a lot of people may disagree with. I think ah if we think about the design of autonomous intelligence system. So assuming that we are somewhat successful at some at some level of getting machines to learn models of the world. Pretty t models of the world. We have we build, intrinsic motivation, objective functions to drive the behavior of that system. The system also has perception modules that allows it to estimate the state of the world and then have some way of figuring out the sequence of actions that you know, to optimize a particular objective if it has a critic of the type that I was describing before, The thing that makes you recoil your arm the second time I tried to pinch you um intelligent determines machine will have emotions. I think emotions are an integral part of autonomous intelligence. If you have an intelligent system that is driven by intrinsic motivation by objectives. If it has a critic that allows you to predict in advance whether the outcome of a the situation is going to be good or bad is going to have emotions, it's going to have fear when it predicts that the outcome is gonna is gonna be bad and and something to avoid is going to have elation when he predicts it is going to be good um if it has drives to relate with humans, um you know, in some ways the way humans have um you know, it's it's going to be social, right?

And so it's going to have emotions about attachment and and things of that type. So um so I think you know, the sort of sci fi thing where you know, you see commander data like having an emotion chip that you can turn off right? Um I think that's ridiculous.

Speaker 1  01:45:13
So, I mean, here's the difficult philosophical social question. Do you think there will be a time like a civil rights movement for robots where um ok forget the movement but a discussion like the Supreme Court, that particular kinds of robots, particular kinds of systems um deserve the same rights as humans because they can suffer just as humans can um all those kinds of things. Well

Speaker 2  01:45:48
perhaps perhaps not like imagine that humans were that that you could you know die and be restored like you know, you could be sort of you know be three D. Reprinted and you know, your brain could be reconstructed in its finest details.

Speaker 1  01:46:02
Our ideas of rights will change in that case. If you can always just there's always a backup you could always restore maybe like the the importance of murder will go down one notch.

Speaker 2  01:46:13
That's right. But also the your your you know desire to do dangerous things like you know, you know doing skydiving or or you know uh or you know racecar driving, you know car racing or that kind of stuff. You know would probably increase or or you know airplane aerobatics or that kind of stuff. Right? It would be fine to do a lot of those things or explore, you know dangerous areas and things like that. It would kind of change your relationship. So now it's very likely that robots will be like that because you know there will be based on perhaps technology that is somewhat similar to to this technology and you can you can always have a backup.

Speaker 1  01:46:54
So it's possible. I don't know if you like video games, but there's a there's a game called Diablo and

Speaker 2  01:47:01
my sons are huge fans of this.

Speaker 1  01:47:03
Yes. In

Speaker 2  01:47:06
fact, they made a game that's inspired by awesome. Like built a game. My three sons have a game design studio between them. Yeah, that's awesome. They came out with a game that just came out last year. No, this was last year. Early last about a year ago.

Speaker 1  01:47:20
That's awesome. But so in Diablo, there's a something called hardcore mode, which if you die, there's no, you're gone. That's it. And so it's possible with the ai systems for them to be able to operate successfully and for us to treat them in a certain way because they have to be integrated in human society. They have to be able to die. No copies allowed. In fact, copying is illegal. It's possible with humans as well. Like cloning will be illegal even what's possible

Speaker 2  01:47:50
because cloning is not copying, right? I mean, you don't reproduce the the mind of the person and like experience, right? It's just a delayed twins.

Speaker 1  01:47:58
But then it's well, but we were talking about with computers that you will be able to copy you, you will be able to perfectly save pickle the mind state. And it's possible that that would be illegal because that goes against, um, that will destroy the motivations of the system.

Speaker 2  01:48:17
Okay, So let's say you you have a domestic

Speaker 1  01:48:20
robot, okay.

Speaker 2  01:48:21
Sometime in the future and uh, domestic robot, you know, comes to you kind of somewhat pre trained. You know, you can do a bunch of things, but it has a particular personality that makes it slightly different from the other robots because that makes them more interesting. And then, because it's, you know, it's lived with you for five years, you've, you've grown some attachment to it and vice versa and it's learned a lot about you. Or maybe it's not a household robot. Maybe it's maybe it's a virtual assistant that lives in your, you know, augmented reality glasses or whatever, right? You know, the her movie type thing, right? Um, and that system, to some extent, the intelligence in that system, it's a bit like your child or maybe a PhD student in the sense that there's a lot of you in that, in that machine now. Right? And so if it were a living thing, you would do this for free if you want, right? If it's your child, your child can, you know, then live his or her own life. And you know, the fact that they learn stuff from you, it doesn't mean that you have any ownership of it, right? But if it's a robot that you've trained, perhaps you have some intellectual property claim about

Speaker 1  01:49:36
intellectual property. Oh, I thought you meant like permanent value in the sense that's part of

Speaker 2  01:49:41
use in this permanent value right? So you would lose a lot if that robot were to be destroyed and you you have no backup. You would lose a lot. You know you have a lot of investment you know kind of like uh you know a person dying you know um That that's a friend of a friend of yours dying or coworker or something like that. Um

Speaker 1  01:50:00
But also you have like intellectual property rights in the sense that that that system is fine tuned to your particular existence. So that's now a very unique instance creation of that original background model, whatever it was that arrived.

Speaker 2  01:50:16
And then there are issues of privacy right? Because now imagine that that robot has its own kind of volition and decides to work for someone else or kind of you know thinks uh life with you is sort of untenable or whatever. Um Now all the all the things that that system learn from you ah you know how can you like you know delete all the personal information that that system knows about you. I mean that would be kind of an ethical question like you know can you erase the mind of intelligent robot to protect your privacy? You can't do this with humans. You can ask them to shut up but that you don't have complete power over them. Can't

Speaker 1  01:50:57
erase humans. Yeah that's the problem with relationships. You know that you break up. You can't you can't erase the other human with robots. I think it will have to be the same thing with robots that that risk that there has to be some risk to our interactions to truly experience them deeply. It feels like so you have to be able to lose your robot friend and that robot friend to go tweeting about how much of an asshole you were.

Speaker 2  01:51:25
But then are you allowed to you know murder the robot to protect your private information? Probably decides to leave.

Speaker 1  01:51:31
I have this situation that for robots with with certain like it's it's almost like regulation if you declare your robot to be let's call it sentient or something like that. Like this this robot is designed for human interaction then you're not allowed to murder these robots. It's the same as murdering of the

Speaker 2  01:51:49
humans. Well but what about you do a backup of the robot you preserve on the on on a hard drive or the equivalent in the future.

Speaker 1  01:51:55
That might be illegal. Just like it's like piracy,

Speaker 2  01:51:58
piracy, piracy is illegal but it's your own it's your own robot right? But you

Speaker 1  01:52:02
can't you don't

Speaker 2  01:52:03
but then but then you can wipe

Speaker 1  01:52:04
out

Speaker 2  01:52:06
his brain so the this robot doesn't know anything about you anymore. But you still have technically it's still in existence because you backed it

Speaker 1  01:52:13
up and then there will be these great speeches at the Supreme Court by saying oh sure you can erase the mind of the robot just like you can erase the mind of a human. We both can suffer. There'll be some epic like Obama type character with a speech that we we like the robots and the humans are the same. We can both suffer. We can both hope we can both all those all those kinds of things raise families, all that kind of stuff. It's it's interesting for these just like you said emotions seems to be a Fascinatingly powerful aspect of human human interaction, human robot interaction. And if they're able to exhibit emotions at the end of the day that's probably going to have us deeply consider human rights like what we value in humans, what we value and other animals. That's why robots and ai is great. It makes us ask

Speaker 2  01:53:05
really good questions. The hard questions. Yeah but you asked about you asked about the chinese room type argument. You know is it real? If it looks real? I think the chinese room argument is a really good this one. So

Speaker 1  01:53:17
so so for people who don't know chinese rumors uh you can you can I don't even know how to formulate it well but basically you can mimic the behavior of an intelligence system by just following a giant algorithm code book that tells you exactly how to respond in exactly each case. But is that really intelligent? It's like a giant look up table when this person says this you answer this when this person says this you answer this. And if you understand how that works, you have this giant, nearly infinite look up table. Is that really intelligence? Because intelligence seems to be a mechanism that's much more interesting and complex than this. Look up

Speaker 2  01:53:56
table. I don't think so. So the I mean, the real question comes down to do you think ah you know, you can you can mechanize intelligence in some way, even if that involves learning. And the answer is of course, yes. There's no question. There's a second question then, which is assuming you can reproduce intelligence in sort of different hardware than biological hardware. You know what our computers. Um can you, you know, match human intelligence in all the domains in which humans are intelligent? Is it possible? Right? So this is quite the hypothesis of strong ai the answer to this in my opinion is unqualified. Yes.

This will this will happen at some point. There's no question that machines at some point will become more intelligent than humans in all domains where humans are intelligent. This is not for tomorrow, it's going to take a long time regardless of what, you know, Iran and others have claimed or believed. Um this is a lot a lot harder than many of many of those guys think it is. Um and many of those guys who thought it was simpler than that years, you know, five years ago now. I think it's hard because it's been five years and they realize it's going to take a lot longer. That includes a bunch of people at Deepmind for example. But um

Speaker 1  01:55:18
interesting, I haven't actually touched base with the deepmind folks, but some of it Ellen or uh I mean sometimes in your role you have to kind of create deadlines that are nearer than farther away to kind of create an urgency because you know, you have to believe the impossible is possible in order to accomplish it. And there's of course a flip side to that coin. But it's, it's a weird, you can't be too cynical if you want to get something

Speaker 2  01:55:44
done. Absolutely, I agree with that. But um, I mean you have to inspire people right to work on sort of ambitious things. Um, so you know, it's, it's uh it's certainly a lot harder than we believe, but there's no question in my mind that this will, this will happen. And now, you know, people are kind of worried about what does that mean for humans? They are going to be brought down from their pedestal, You know, a bunch of notches with that and uh, you know, is that going to be good or bad? I mean it's just going to give more power right? It's an amplifier for human intelligence really.

Speaker 1  01:56:17
So speaking of doing cool ambitious things Fair, the Facebook Ai Research Group has recently celebrated its 8th birthday or maybe you can correct me on that. Looking back what has been the successes, the failures, the lessons learned from the eight years affair. And maybe you can also give context of where it is the newly minted meta AI fit into how does it relate to

Speaker 2  01:56:44
fair? Right. So let me tell you a bit about the organization of all this. Uh Yeah, Fair was created almost exactly eight years ago. It wasn't called Fair yet. It took that name a few a few months later. Um and at the time I joined facebook, um there was a group called the AI group that had 12 engineers and a few a few scientists like, you know, 10 engineers and two scientists or something like that. I run it for 3.5 years as a director, you know, hire the first few scientists and kind of set up the culture and organized it. You know, explained to the facebook leadership, what what fundamental research was about and how it can work within uh industry and how it needs to be open and everything. And I think it's been an unqualified success in the sense that fair has simultaneously produced, you know, top level research and advance the science and the technology provided tools, open source tools like pytorch and many others. Uh but at the same time as had a direct or mostly indirect impact on facebook at the time, no matter in the sense that a lot of systems that are that meta is built around now are, are based on research projects that started at at fair. So if you were to take out, you know deep running out of facebook services now and meta more generally, I mean the company would, would literally crumble.

I mean it's completely built around around the eye these days and it's really essential to the operations. So what happened after 3.5 years is that I changed rural, I became chief scientist so I'm not doing day to day management of affair anymore and more of a kind of, you know, think about strategy and things like that and I carry my, I conduct my own research, I have you know, my own kind of research group working on self supervised learning and things like this, which I didn't have time to do when I was director. Um, so now Fair is run by joelle Pineau and onto onboard together because fear is gonna split into now there's something called Fair labs which is sort of bottom up census driven research and Fair Excel which is slightly more organized for bigger projects that require a little more kind of focus and more engineering support and things like that. So Joel needs for our lab and it's the localized all over. So there's there's no question that the leadership of the company believes that this was a very worthwhile investment and what that means is that ah it's, it's there for the long run. Right? So there is uh, if you, if you want to talk in these terms, which I don't like this, there's a business model if you want. Where where fair, despite being a very fundamental research, lab brings a lot of value to the company either mostly indirectly through other groups. Um, Now, what happened 3.5 years ago when I stepped down is was also the creation of facebook Ai, which was basically a larger organization that uh, covers fair. So fare is included in it, but also has other organizations that are uh focused on applied research or advanced development of AI technology that is more, you know, focused on the

Speaker 1  02:00:15
products of the company's or less emphasis on fundamental research.

Speaker 2  02:00:18
Less fundamental. But it's still research. I mean, there's a lot of papers coming out of those organizations and uh, people are awesome, awesome and you know, wonderful to interact with. And, but it, it serves as kind of a way to kind of scale up if you want some sort of AI technology which, you know, maybe very experimental and, and sort of lab prototypes into things that are usable.

Speaker 1  02:00:42
So fair is a subset of meta ai. It's fair become like KFC. It'll just keep the f nobody cares what the F stands for

Speaker 2  02:00:50
Will not be good enough by probably probably by the end of the 2021.

Speaker 1  02:00:57
That's not a giant change. Mayor fare

Speaker 2  02:01:00
well, Mayor doesn't sound too good, but, you know, the brand people are kind of deciding on this and they've been hesitating for for a while now. And they, you know, they tell us they're going to come up with an answer as to whether affair is going to change name or whether we're going to change just the meaning of the F.

Speaker 1  02:01:15
That's a good call. I would keep fair and change the meaning of the

Speaker 2  02:01:17
F. That would be my preference. You know, I would tend to turn the F into fundamental fundamental research.

Speaker 1  02:01:24
That's really good

Speaker 2  02:01:25
mate. So this would be a fair maid affair. But you know, people would call it fair. Right?

Speaker 1  02:01:30
Exactly like

Speaker 2  02:01:31
it. And now mira ai uh is part of the reality lab. So you know, meta. Now the new facebook crisis cometa. And it's kind of divided into, you know, facebook instagram WhatsApp and reality. That reality that is about, you know, a RVR um you know, today presents communication technology and stuff like that. That's kind of the you can think of it as the sort of a combination of um sort of new products and and technology. Part of of

Speaker 1  02:02:13
is that where the touch sensing for robots. I saw that you were posting about. That's

Speaker 2  02:02:17
that's something for robot is part of fair actually that's that's what

Speaker 1  02:02:20
it is. Okay.

Speaker 2  02:02:22
This is also the number. There is the other way the the haptic glove,

Speaker 1  02:02:27
right? Yes. That has like that's more reality.

Speaker 2  02:02:29
That's that's reality lab research

Speaker 1  02:02:32
about the lab research but by the way the touch sensors are super interesting uh like integrating that modality into the whole uh sensing suite is very interesting. So ah what do you think about the metaverse? What do you think about this whole uh this whole kind of expansion of the view of the role of facebook and meta in the

Speaker 2  02:02:52
world metaverse really should be thought of as the next step in the internet, right? Sort of trying to uh kinda you know, make the experience more compelling um of you know, being connected either with other people or with content. Um and you know, we are evolved and trying to evolve in, you know, through the environments where uh you know, we can see other people, we can talk to them when you when you were near them or you know, and other viewer far away can hear us, you know, things like that. Right. So it's there's a lot of social conventions that exist in the real world that we can try to transpose now, what is going to be eventually the the how compelling is it going to be like, are you know, is it going to be the case that people are going to be willing to do this if they have to wear, you know, a huge pair of goggles all day? Maybe not. But

Speaker 1  02:03:48
then again, if the experience is sufficiently compelling maybe so

Speaker 2  02:03:52
or if the device that you have to wear is just basically a pair of glasses, you know, technology make sufficient progress for that. Um um you know, a R is a much easier concept to grasp that you're going to have, you know, augmented reality glasses that basically contains some sort of, you know virtual assistant that can help you in your daily lives.

Speaker 1  02:04:12
But the same at the same time with the er you have to contend with reality with VR, you can completely detach yourself from reality so it gives you freedom. It might be easier to design worlds and in VR

Speaker 2  02:04:22
Yeah, but you can imagine how, you know the metaverse being a mix, a mix, right? Or or like you can have objects that exist in the metaverse that you know, pop up on top of the real world or only exist in virtual reality.

Speaker 1  02:04:36
Okay, let me ask the hard question

Speaker 2  02:04:38
because all of this was easy.

Speaker 1  02:04:40
So this was easy. The facebook now, meta, the social network has been painted by the media has a net negative for society, even destructive and evil at times you've pushed back against this defending facebook. Can you explain your defense?

Speaker 2  02:04:58
Yeah, so the, the description the company that is being described in the in some media, uh it's not the company we know when we work inside and you know, it could be claimed that a lot of employees are uninformed about what really goes on in the company, but you know, I'm a vice president. I mean I have a pretty good vision of what goes on, you know, I don't know everything, obviously I'm not involved in in in everything, but certainly not in decision about like, you know, content moderation or anything like this, but but as you know, some decent vision of what what goes on and this evil that is being described, I just don't see it. And then, you know, I think there is an easy story to buy which is that, you know, all the bad things in the in the world and you know, the reason your friend believe crazy stuff. Um you know, there's an easy scapegoat right in a uh in in in in social media in general facebook in particular. But you have to look at the data. Like is it the case that facebook, for example, polarizes people politically? Are their academic studies that show this is it the case that, you know, teenagers think of themselves less if they use instagram or is it the case that, you know, people get more riled up against, you know, opposite sides in a in a debate or political opinion. If they if they are more on facebook or if they are less and study after study show that none of this is true. This is independent studies by academics are not funded by facebook or meta. Um you know, study by stanford by some of my colleagues at N. Y. U.

Actually with whom I have no connection. Um You know there's a study recently. They paid people I think it was in um bang in in the former Yugoslavia. I'm not exactly sure what what part but they pay people to not use facebook for a while in the period before the anniversary of the cyber Nietzsche massacres. Right? So you know people get riled up like should you know should we have a celebration? I mean a memorial kind of celebration for it or not. So they paid a bunch of people to not use facebook for a few weeks. It turns out that those people ended up being more polarized than they were at the beginning and the people who are more on facebook were less polarized. Um There's a study you know from stanford of economist at stanford that try to identify the causes of increasing polarization in the US And it's been going on for 40 years before you know Mark Zuckerberg was born continuously. And um and so that if there is a cause it's not facebook or social media. So you can say if social media just accelerated.

But no I mean it's basically a continuous Evolution by some measure of polarization in the us and then you compare this with other countries like uh the west half of Germany because you can go 40 years in the East East side or Denmark or or other countries. Ah And they use facebook just as much and they're not getting more polarized, they're getting less polarized. So if you want to look for you know a causal relationship there um you can find a scapegoat but you can't find a cause. Now if you want to fix the problem, you have to find the right cause. And what rise me up is that people now are accusing facebook of bad deeds that are done by others and those others are, we're not doing anything about them. And by the way, those others include the owner of the Wall Street Journal in which all of those papers were published.

Speaker 1  02:08:39
So I should mention that I'm talking to schlep mike Schroepfer on this podcast and also Mark Zuckerberg and probably is a conversation you can have with them because it's very interesting to me, even if facebook has has some measurable negative effect, you can't just consider that in isolation. You have to consider about all the positive ways that connects us. So like every technology, you can't just say like uh there's an increasing division. Yes, probably google search engine has created increasing division. We have to consider about how much information is brought to the world. Like I'm sure Wikipedia created more division. If you just look at the division, we have to look at the full context of the world and that didn't make a better world, you have to, the printing

Speaker 2  02:09:22
press has created more different. Exactly. So you know when the printing press was invented, the first books that were, that were printed were things like the bible and that allowed people to read the bible by themselves, not get the message uniquely from priests in europe And that created, you know, the Protestant movement and 200 years of religious persecution and wars. So that's a bad side effect of the printing press. You know, social networks aren't being nearly as bad as the printing press, but nobody would say the printing press was a bad idea.

Speaker 1  02:09:54
Mhm. Yeah, a lot of his perception and there's a lot of different incentives operating here. Um maybe a quick comment since you're one of the top leaders at facebook and at meta, sorry, that's in the tech space. I'm sure facebook involves a lot of incredible technological challenges that need to be solved. A lot of it probably is in the computer infrastructure, the hardware, the I mean, it's just a huge amount. Uh maybe can you give me context about how much of Schweppes life is A. I and how much of it is low level compute how much of it is flying all around doing business stuff. And the same with Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg,

Speaker 2  02:10:33
they really focus on ai I mean, certainly uh in the in the run up of the creation affair and for, you know, at least a year after that, if not more. Mark was, was very, very much focused on on the eye and was spending quite a lot of effort on it. And that's his style when he gets interested in something, he reads everything about it, you know, he read some of my papers, for example, before I joined um um and uh so he learned a lot about it, like, right. Um and uh you know, Schrempp was really to it, but also, I mean, shrimp is really kind of um you know, has something I've tried to preserve also despite my not so young age, which is a sense of wonder about science and technology and it certainly it certainly has that. Um he's also a wonderful person. I mean, in terms of like as a manager, like dealing with people and everything, Mark also actually. Um so I mean, they're very like, you know, very human people for in the case of markets, shockingly human, you know, given is uh his trajectory. Uh I mean, the personality of of him that he spent in the press is just completely wrong.

Speaker 1  02:11:51
Yeah, but you have to know how to play the press. So that's I I put some of that responsibility on him too. You have to, it's like um you know, like the director, the conductor of an orchestra, you have to play the press and the public in a certain kind of way where you convey your true self to them if there's a depth and kind of

Speaker 2  02:12:13
start and it's like, it's probably not the best at it. So yeah, you

Speaker 1  02:12:18
have to learn uh and it's it's sad to see and I'll talk to him about it. But the shrimp is slowly stepping down. It's always sad to see folks sort of be there for a long time and slowly I guess time,

Speaker 2  02:12:32
you know, I think it's, I think it's done the thing he set out to do and you know, is is got you know, family priorities and stuff like that. And um I understand, you know after 13 years or something, it's been a good run which in Silicon Valley is basically a lifetime. Yeah. You know because you know it's dog years.

Speaker 1  02:12:56
So in europe's the conference just wrapped up. Let me just go back to something else. You posted the paper you co authored was rejected from europe as you said proudly and quotes rejected. Can you? Yeah, I know. Uh can you describe this paper and like what was the idea and it and also maybe this is a good opportunity to ask what are the pros and cons what works and what doesn't about the review process.

Speaker 2  02:13:25
Yeah. Let me talk about the paper first. I'll talk about talk about the ritual process afterwards. Um The paper is called V craig. So this is, I mentioned that before, variance invariants, invariants regularization and it's a technique and non contrasted learning technique for what I call joint invading architecture. So Sammy's nets are an example of joint invading architecture. So joint invading architecture is ah uh let me back up a little bit. Right? So if you want to do self supervised running, you can you can do it by prediction. Um So let's say you want to train the system to predict video right? You show it a video clip and uh and you train the system to predict the next the continuation of that video clip. Now because you need to handle uncertainty because there are many, you know, many continuations that are plausible.

You need to have you need to handle this in some way. You need to have a way for the system to be able to produce multiple predictions. And the way the only way I know to do this is who was called a latent variable. So you have some sort of hidden vector of a variable that you can vary over a set or draw from the distribution. And as you vary this vector over a set. The output. The prediction varies over a set of plausible predictions. Okay, so that's called this a generative latent variable model. Got him. Okay, now there is an alternative to this to handle uncertainty. And instead of directly predicting the the next frames of the of the of the clip. You also run those through another neural net.

So you now have two neural nets. One that looks at the the, you know, the initial segment of the video clip and another one that looks at the continuation during training, right? And what what you're trying to do is learn a representation of those two video clips. That is maximally informative about the video clips themselves. But is such that you can predict the representation of the second video clip from the representation of the first one easily. Okay. And you can sort of formalize this in terms of maximizing ritual information and some stuff like that, but it doesn't matter what you want is informative representative represents. You know, informative representations of the two video clips that are mutually predictable. What that means is that there's a lot of details in the second video clips that are irrelevant. Uh you know, um I let's say video clip consistent, you know, camera panning the scene. Uh there's gonna be a piece of that room that is going to be revealed. And I can somewhat predict what the what that room is gonna look like, but I may not be able to predict the details of the texture of the ground and where the tiles are ending and stuff like that.

Right? So those are irrelevant details that perhaps my representation will eliminate. And so what I need is to trend this second neural net in such a way that whenever the continuation video clip varies of all the plausible continuations, the representation doesn't change.

Speaker 1  02:16:37
Got it. So it's the Yeah, yeah. Got it over the space of representations. Doing the same kind of thing as you're dealing with similarity learning.

Speaker 2  02:16:47
So, so these are two ways to handle multi modality in the prediction. Right? In the first way you pressurize the prediction with a latent variable, but you predict pixels essentially right. In the second one, you don't you don't predict pixels, you predict an abstract representation of pixels and you guarantee that this abstract representation as as much information as possible about the input, but sort of, you know, drops all the stuff that you really can't predict essentially. Ah I used to be a big fan of the first approach and in fact in this paper with HN Mishra, this this broad coast, the dark matter intelligence, I was kind of advocating for this and in the last year and a half, I've completely changed my mind. I'm now a big fan of the second one. Ah and it's because of uh a small collection of algorithms that have been proposed over the last year and a half or so two years to do this, including v craig its predecessor called Barber twins, which I mentioned a method from our friends at Deepmind could be way well um and and and there's a bunch of others now that kind of work similarly. So they're all based on this idea of joint embedding some of them have an explicit criterion. That is an approximation of mutual information, some others would be way will work, but we don't really know why. And there's been like lots of theoretical papers about why be where it works. No, it's not that because we take it out and it still works and you know, blah blah blah, I mean, so there's like a big, big debate, but but the important point is that we now have a collection of non contrast tiv joint embedding methods, which I think is the best thing since sliced bread. So I'm super excited about this because I think it's our best shot for techniques that would allow us to kind of build predictive models and at the same time learn hierarchical representations of the world, where what matters about the world is preserved and what is irrelevant is eliminated

Speaker 1  02:18:36
by the way the representations that before and after is in the space in a sequence of images. Or is it for single images?

Speaker 2  02:18:43
It would be either for a single image for a sequence, it doesn't have to be images. This could be applied to text. This could be applied to just about any signal I'm looking at. You know, I'm looking for methods that are generally applicable that are not specific to one particular modality. You know, it could be audio or

Speaker 1  02:18:59
whatever. Got it. So what's the story behind this paper? This this paper is what is describing one of the one such

Speaker 2  02:19:05
method? Is this the correct method? So this is co authored. The first author is a student called Adrien Byrne, who is a resident PhD student at fair paris the school advised by me and jean, um who's a professor at the economist, also director Andrea. So this is a wonderful program in France where PhD students can basically do their PhD in industry and that's that's kind of what what's happening here. Um and this paper is a photo up on uh this bottle twin paper. But yeah, my former postdoc now Stephanie with leasing and you're a monster and a bunch of other people from from from fair. And one of the main criticism from reviewers is that craig is not different enough from bali twins, but you know, my impression is that it's you know about the twins with a few bugs fixed essentially. And in the end this is what people will use,

Speaker 1  02:20:05
right? So

Speaker 2  02:20:06
but you know, I'm used to stuff that estimate being rejected

Speaker 1  02:20:10
for it might be rejected actually exceptionally well cited because people use

Speaker 2  02:20:13
it. It's already decided like a bunch of times. So,

Speaker 1  02:20:17
I mean, the question is then to the deeper question about peer review and conferences, I mean, computer science is a field is kind of unique that the conference is highly prized. That's one and uh it's interesting because the peer review process, they're similarly supposed to journals, but it's accelerated significantly or not significantly, but it goes fast and it's a nice way to get stuff out quickly uh to be reviewed quickly, go to present it quickly to the community. So not quickly but quicker, but nevertheless it has many of the same flaws of peer review, because it's a limited number of people look at it, there's bias and the following like that if you want to do new ideas, you're gonna get pushed back. Um they're self interested people that kinda can infer who submitted it and kind of, you know, be cranky about it, all that kind of

Speaker 2  02:21:09
stuff. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of, you know, social phenomenon there, um there's one social phenomenon which is that because the field has been growing exponentially, the vast majority of people in the field are extremely

Speaker 1  02:21:21
junior. So

Speaker 2  02:21:22
as a consequence, and that's just a consequence of the field growing right? So as the number of the size of the field kind of start saturating you, you will have less of that problem of reviewers being very inexperienced. The consequence of this is that, you know, young reviewers, I mean, there's a phenomenon which is that reviewers try to make their life easy and to make their life easier when reviewing a paper, it's very simple, you just have to find a flaw in the paper. Right? So basically, they see their task as finding flaws in papers, and most papers have flaws, even the good ones. Um so, it's it's easy to, you know, to do that, your job is easier as a reviewer, if you just focus on this, but what's important is like, is there a new idea in that paper that is likely to influence it doesn't matter if the experiments are not that great if the protocol is ah so so you know, things like that, as long as there is a worthy idea in it that will influence the way people think about the problem um even if they make it better, you know, eventually I think that's uh that's really what what makes a paper useful and so this combination of social phenomena creates a disease that has plagued you know, other fields in the past, like speech recognition where basically, you know, people chase numbers on on benchmarks um and and it's much easier to get a paper accepted if it brings an incremental improvement on a sort of mainstream well accepted method or a problem. Um and those are to me, boring papers, I mean they're not useless, right? Because industry, you know, strives on on those kind of progress, but they're not the ones that I'm interested in in terms of like new concepts, new ideas. So papers that are really trying to strike kind of new advances generally don't make it. Now, thankfully we have our cave

Speaker 1  02:23:26
archive. Exactly. And then there's open review type of situations where you and then, I mean twitter is a kind of open review. I'm a huge believer that review should be done by thousands of people, not to people. And so archive, do you see a future where a lot of really strong papers, it's already the present, but a growing future where it will just be archive and you're presenting an ongoing continuous conference called twitter and slashed the internet uh slash archive sanity. Andre just released a new version uh suggest not, you know, not being so elitist about this particular gating.

Speaker 2  02:24:05
It's not a question of being elitist or not. It's a question of being basically recommendation and set of approvals for people who don't see themselves as having the ability to do so by themselves. Right. And so it saves time, right? If you rely on other people's opinion and you trust those people, all those groups to evaluate a paper for you. Um that saves you time because you know, you don't have to like scrutinize the paper as much, you know, is brought to your attention. I mean that's the whole idea of sort of, you know, collective recommended system. Right? So I actually thought about this a lot um you know about 10, 15 years ago because there were discussions that nips and you know, and we're about to create a clear with your banjo. And so I wrote a document um kind of describing a reviewing system which basically was, you know, you post your paper on some repository, let's say archive or now could be open review. Um and then you can form a reviewing entity which is equivalent to a reviewing board, you know, a general or um program community of a conference. Um you have to list the members and then um that group reviewing entity can choose to review a particular paper spontaneously or not.

There is no exclusive relationship anymore between a paper and a venue or reviewing entity. Any reviewing entity can review any paper or may choose not to. Ah And then, you know, given evaluation, it's not traditional published. It's just an evaluation and the comment which would be public signed by the reviewing entity. And if it's signed by reviewing entity, you know, it's one of the members of reviewing entity. So if the reviewing entity is, you know, lex treatments, you know, preferred papers, right? You know, it's lex Friedman writing the review.

Speaker 1  02:25:57
Yes. What? So for me, one that's a beautiful um system I think. But what's in addition to that, it feels like there should be a reputation system for the reviewers

Speaker 2  02:26:09
for the reviewing entities, another reviewer individually reviewing

Speaker 1  02:26:12
entities. Sure. But even within that there are viewers too. Because there's another thing here, it's not just the reputation, it's an incentive for an individual person to do great right now, in in the academic setting, the incentive is kind of uh internal just wanting to do a good job. But honestly, that's not a strong enough incentive to do a really good job in reading a paper and finding the beautiful amidst the mistakes and the flaws and all that kind of stuff. Like if you're the person that first discovered a powerful paper and you get to be proud of that discovery, then that gives a huge incentive to

Speaker 2  02:26:49
you. That's that's a big part of my proposal. Actually. I described that as, you know, if if your evaluation of papers is predictive of future success, okay, then your reputation should go up as a reviewing entity. Um, so yeah, exactly. I mean that that um I even had a master student who is a master student in library science and computer science actually kind of work out exactly how that should work with formulas and everything, but

Speaker 1  02:27:17
also in terms of implementation, do you think that's something that's

Speaker 2  02:27:19
doable? I mean, I've been sort of, you know, talking about this to sort of various people like, you know, Andrew Mccallum who started open review and the reason why we picked open review for a clear initially, even though it was very early for them, um is because my hope was that I clear where it was eventually going to kind of inaugurate this type of system. So I clear kept the idea of open reviews. So when the reviews are published with the paper, which I think is very useful, but in many ways that's kind of reverted to kind of more of a conventional type conferences for everything else. And that, I mean, I I don't run, I clear, I'm just the president of the Foundation, but um, you know, people who run it should make decisions about how to run it and I'm not going to tell them because there are volunteers. And I'm really thankful that they do that. So, but I'm saddened by the fact that we're not being innovative enough.

Speaker 1  02:28:18
Yeah, me too. I hope that changes. Uh, yeah. Because the communication of science broadly with the communication of computer science ideas is how you make those ideas have impact, I

Speaker 2  02:28:30
think. Yeah. And I think, you know, a lot of this is because people have in their minds kind of an objective, which is, you know, fairness for authors and the ability to count points basically and give credits accurately. But that comes at the expense of the progress of science. So to some extent we're slowing down the progress of science

Speaker 1  02:28:54
and that we actually achieving fairness

Speaker 2  02:28:56
and we're not achieving fairness. You know, we have biases, you know, we're doing, you know, double blind review. But uh, you know, the biases are still there. They're different, different kinds of biases.

Speaker 1  02:29:07
You write that the phenomenon of emergence, collective behavior exhibited by a large collection of simple elements in interaction is one of the things that got you into neural nets in the first place? I love cellular automata. I love simple interacting elements and the things that emerged from them. Do you think we understand how complex systems can emerge from such simple components that interact simply?

Speaker 2  02:29:33
No, we don't. It's a big mystery also, it's a mystery for physicists. It's a mystery for biologists. Um, you know, how is it that the universe around us seems to be increasing in complexity and not decreasing. I mean that that that is a kind of curious property of physics that despite the second law of thermodynamics, we seem to be, you know, evolution and learning and etcetera seems to be kind of at least locally to increase complexity, not decrease it. So perhaps the ultimate purpose of the universe is just get more complex.

Speaker 1  02:30:10
Have these I mean, small pockets of beautiful complexity. Uh Does that to sell your tom into these kinds of emergency and complex systems give you some intuition or guide your understanding of machine learning systems and neural networks and so on? Or are these for you right now desperate concepts.

Speaker 2  02:30:31
Well, it got it got me into it, you know, I discovered the existence of the perceptron when I was a college student, you know, by reading a good book and it was a debate between chomsky and P. R. J. And Seymour Papert from M. I. T. Was kind of singing the praise of the perception in that book. And I first time I heard about the running machine. Right? So I started digging the literature and I found those paper those books which were basically transcript transcription of you know, workshops or conferences from the fifties and sixties about self organizing systems. So there were there was a series of conferences on self organizing systems and these books on this? Um some of them are, you can actually get them at the internet archive, you know, the digital version and there are like fascinating articles in there by, there's a guy whose name has been largely forgotten, Heinz von Foerster.

So the german physicist who immigrated to the US and worked on self organizing systems In the, in the 50's And in the 60s, he created at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. He created a biological computer laboratory, BCL, which was all about neural nets. Unfortunately, that was kind of towards the end of the popularity of neural nets. So that that lab never kind of strive very much, but but he ordered a bunch of papers about self organization and about the mystery of self organization. An example he has is you take, imagine you are in space, there's no gravity. You have a big box with magnets in it. Okay. Um you know what kind of rectangular magnets with north pole and one end on the other end, you shake the box gently and the magnets will kind of stick to themselves and probably formed a complex structure. Um, you know, spontaneously, um, you know, that could be an example of self organization, but you know, you have lots of examples, neural nets are an example of self organization to, you know, in any respect. And it's a it's a bit of a mystery um you know, how like, what, what is possible with this, um, you know, pattern formation in physical systems in chaotic system and things like that, you know, you know, the emergence of life, you know, things like that. So, you know, how does does that happen? It's a, it's a big puzzle for physicists as well.

Speaker 1  02:32:44
It feels like understanding this. The mathematics of emergence and some constrained situations might help us create intelligence. Like help us add a little spice to the systems because you seem to be able to in complex systems with emergence to be able to get a lot from little. And so that seems like a shortcut to get big leaps in performance. But

Speaker 2  02:33:13
there's, there's a missing sincerity concept that we are, we don't have. And it's, it's something also I've been fascinated by since my undergrad days and it's how you measure complexity, right? So we don't actually have good ways of measuring or at least we don't have good ways of interpreting the measures that we have at our disposal. Like how do you measure the complexity of something? Right. So there's all those things, you know, like, you know, commodore of cheating, Solomon of complexity of, you know, the length of the shortest program that would generate a blistering can be thought of as the complexity of that blistering, right? Um, I've been fascinated by the concept. The problem with that is that, uh, that complexity is defined up to a constant, which can be very large. There's, there are similar concepts that are derived from, you know, uh you know, vision probability theory where you know, the complexity of something is the negative log of its probability essentially. Right. And you have a complete equivalence between the two things and then you would think, you know, the probability is something that's well defined mathematically, which means complexity is well defined, but it's not true. You need to have a model of of of the distribution and you may need to have a prior if you're doing Beijing's influence and the prior place the same world as the choice of the computer with which you measure commodore of complexity.

And so every measure of complexity we have has some arbitrary and accident um you know, an additive constant, which is can be arbitrarily large. And so, you know, how can we come up with a good theory of how things become more complex? If we don't have a good measure of

Speaker 1  02:34:48
complexity which we need for is one way that people study this in the space of biology, the people that study the origin of life or try to recreate life in the laboratory. And the more interesting one is the Alien one is when we go to other planets, how do we recognize this life? Because, you know complexity, we associate complexity maybe some level of mobility with life. You know, we have to be able to like have concrete algorithms for like um measuring the level of complexity we see in order to know the difference between life and non life

Speaker 2  02:35:25
and the problem is that complexity is in the Iot beholder. So let me give you an example if I if I give you an image of the endless digits, right? And I flipped through in these digits there is some obviously some structure to it because local structure, you know, neighboring pixels are correlated across the entire dataset. I imagine that I apply a random permutation to all the pixels fixed random permutation. I show you those images they will look, you know, really disorganized to you. More complex. In fact, they're not more complex in absolute terms, they're exactly the same as originally. Right? And if you knew what the permutation was, you know, you could undo the permutation. Now, imagine I give you special glasses that undo that permutation. Now, all of a sudden what looked complicated becomes simple, right? So if you have to, if you have, you know, humans on one end and then another race of aliens that sees the universe with permutation glasses,

Speaker 1  02:36:28
glasses,

Speaker 2  02:36:29
what we perceive as simple to them is hardly complicated is probably heat.

Speaker 1  02:36:34
Heat

Speaker 2  02:36:35
Okay. And what they perceive as simple to us is random fluctuation. It's heat. Yeah, truly in

Speaker 1  02:36:43
the eye of the beholder, it depends what kind of glasses you're wearing, depends what kind of algorithm you're running in your perception system.

Speaker 2  02:36:50
So I don't think we'll have a theory of intelligence, self organization evolution, things like this until we have a good handle on a notion of complexity, which we know is in the higher the eye of the beholder.

Speaker 1  02:37:04
Yeah, it's sad to think that we might not be able to detect or interact with alien species because we're wearing different glasses,

Speaker 2  02:37:11
because the notion of locality might be different from ours. This actually connects with fascinating questions in physics at the moment. Like modern physics, quantum physics, like, you know, questions about like, you know, can we recover the information that's lost in a black hole and things like this? Right. And and that relies on notions of complexity, um which, you know, I find, I find this fascinating.

Speaker 1  02:37:33
Can you describe your personal quest to build an expressive electronic wind instrument? E w I what is it, what does it take to ah to build

Speaker 2  02:37:45
it? Well, I'm a tinkerer. I like building things. I like building things with combinations of electronics and, you know, mechanical stuff. Um you know, I have a bunch of different hobbies, but um you know, probably my first one was little was building model airplanes and stuff like that, and they still do that to some extent, but also electronics. I taught myself electronics before I studied it. Um and the reason I taught myself electronics is because of music. Um my cousin, it was inspiring electronic musician and he had an analog synthesizer and it was, you know, basically modifying it for him and building sequences and stuff like that. Right for him. I was, I was in high school when I was doing this

Speaker 1  02:38:24
has the interesting like progressive rock like eighties. Like what's what's the greatest band of all time According to,

Speaker 2  02:38:31
there's too, there's too many of them. But you know, it's a combination of uh, you know, my additional orchestra, weather report. Yes, genesis, you know genesis, Peter Gabriel, gentle giant, you know, things like that.

Speaker 1  02:38:51
Okay, so this, this love of electronics and this love of music combined together.

Speaker 2  02:38:56
Right. So I was actually trying to play uh baroque and renaissance music and I played in uh orchestra when I was in high school and uh first years of college and I played the recorder, crumb horn, a little bit of a bow, you know, things like that. So, I mean I'm a wind instrument player but always wanted to play improvised music even though I don't know anything about it. Uh and the only way I figured, you know, short of like learning to play the saxophone was to play electronic instruments so they behave the fingering is similar to a saxophone but you know, you have a wide variety of sound because you control the synthesizer with it. So I had a bunch of those, you know, going back to the late 80's from either Yamaha or okay, they both kind of the main manufacturers of those that they were classically, you know, going back several decades but I've never been completely satisfied with them because of lack of expressivity and you know those things you know are somewhat expressive. I mean they measure the breast pressure, they measure the lip pressure and you know you have various parameters. You can you can vary with fingers but they They are not really as expressive as a acoustic instrument. Right? You you hear John Culture and play two notes and you hear, you know, it's john Coltrane, you know, it's got a unique sound or or mice Davis, right? You can hear it's mike Davis playing the trumpet because the sound reflects their mhm. You know physiognomy basically the shape of the vocal track um kind of shapes the sound. So how how do you do this with electronic instrument?

And I was many years ago I met a guy called David Wessel. He he was a professor at Berkeley and created the the center for like you know music technology there. And he was interested in that question. Mhm. And so I kept kind of thinking about this for many years. And finally because of Covid, you know, I was at home, I was in my workshop, my workshop serves also as my kind of zoom room and home office and

Speaker 1  02:40:59
this is in New Jersey

Speaker 2  02:41:00
in New Jersey and I started really being serious about you know building my own instrument.

Speaker 1  02:41:07
What else is going on? And then New Jersey workshop. Is there some some some crazy stuff you built like just or or like left on the workshop floor, left

Speaker 2  02:41:16
behind. A lot of crazy stuff is uh, you know, electronics were built with microcontrollers of various kinds and you know weird flying contraptions.

Speaker 1  02:41:28
So you still love flying,

Speaker 2  02:41:30
it's a family disease. My, my dad got me into it when I was a kid and uh he was building model airplanes when he was a kid and uh, and he was a mechanical engineer, he taught himself electronics also. So he built his early radio control systems in the sixties, early seventies. Um, and so that, that, that's what got me into, I mean he got me into kind of, you know, engineering and science and technology.

Speaker 1  02:41:55
You also have an interest in appreciation of flight in other forms like with drones, squad raptors or do you, is it, is it model airplane? The,

Speaker 2  02:42:03
you know, I, you know, before drones were you know, kind of consumer products. Um, you know, I built my own, you know, with also building a microcontroller with gyroscopes and accelerometers for stabilization, writing the firmware for it, you know, and then when it became kind of a standard thing you could buy, it was boring, you know, I stopped doing it, it was fun anymore.

Speaker 1  02:42:24
Um, yeah, you were doing it before. It was cool. What advice would you give to a young person today in high school and college that dreams of doing something big like Yama kun, let's talk in the space of intelligence. Dreams of having a chance to solve some fundamental problem in space of intelligence, both with their career and just in life being somebody who was a part of creating something special.

Speaker 2  02:42:52
So try to get interested by big questions, things like you know, what is intelligence? Uh what is the universe made of, what's life all about things like that um Like even like crazy big questions like what's time like nobody knows what time is. Um and and then learn basic things like basic methods either from math, from physics or from engineering things that have a long shelf life. Um Like if you have a choice between like you know learning, you know mobile programming on iphone or quantum mechanics to quantum mechanics because you're gonna learn things that you have no idea exist and and you may not you never, you know, you may never be a quantum physicist but you will learn about path integral zand, path integral czar used everywhere. It's the same formula that you use for you know, vision integration and stuff like that.

Speaker 1  02:43:55
So the idea is the little ideas within quantum mechanics with within some of these kind of more solidified fields will have a longer shelf life that you somehow use indirectly in your

Speaker 2  02:44:08
work learn classical mechanics. Like you learn about engines for example um which is like a huge, hugely useful concept. You know for all kinds of different things, learn uh statistical physics because all the math that comes out of, you know, for machine learning basically comes out of was figured out by statistical physicist in the, you know, late 19th, early 20th century. Right? So, um and for some of them, actually more recently for by people like Giorgio parisi, who just got the Nobel prize for the replica method, among other things. Um it's used for a lot of different things uh you know, vaginal influence that math comes from statistical physics. So, um so a lot of those kind of, you know, busy courses, you know, you'll, you'll if you do electrical engineering, you take signal processing, you'll you'll learn about for your transforms. Again, something super useful. It's at the basis of things like graph neural nets, which is an entirely new sub area of, you know, ai machine learning. Deep learning, which I think is super promising for all kinds of applications. Um something very promising if you're more interested in applications in the applications of Ai machine learning and Deep learning to Science or two science that can help solve big problems in the world. I have colleagues that admit at fair, we started this project called open catalyst and it's it's an open project collaborative.

And the idea is to use deep learning to help design new chemical compounds or materials that would facilitate the separation of hydrogen from oxygen if you can efficiently separate oxygen from hydrogen with electricity, you solve climate change. It's as simple as that because um, you, you cover, you know, some random desert with solar panels, uh, and you have to have them work all day produce hydrogen and then you see the adrenaline wherever it's needed, you don't need anything else. Um, you know, you you have controllable power, that's, you know, it can be transported anywhere. So if we, if we have a large scale efficient energy storage technology like producing hydrogen, we solve climate change. Here's another way to solve climate change is figuring out how to make fusion work. Another problem with fusion is that you make a super hot plasma and the plasma is unstable and you can't control it. Maybe with deep learning, you can find controllers that will stabilize plasma and make, you know, practical fusion reactors. I mean, that's very speculative, but you know, it's worth trying because um, you know, it's the payoff is huge. There's a group of google working on this led by jOHn Platt.

Speaker 1  02:46:52
So control convert as many problems in science and physics and biology and chemistry into a and to learn about the problem and see if a machine can learn

Speaker 2  02:47:02
it right. I mean, there's properties of, you know, complex materials that we don't understand from first principle for example. Right? So, you know, if we could design new, um, you know, new materials, we could make more efficient batteries. You know, we could make maybe faster electronics. We could, I mean, there's a lot of things we can imagine uh doing or you know lighter materials for for cars or airplanes and things like that. Maybe better fuel cells. I mean there's all kinds of stuff we can imagine if we had good fuel cells, hydrogen fuel cells, we could use them to power airplanes and you know transportation wouldn't be or cars and we wouldn't have emission problem. C. 02 emission problems for for air transportation anymore. So there's there's a lot of those things I think where ai you know, can be used uh and and this is not even talking about all the sort of medicine, biology and and everything like that. Right.

You know like protein folding, you know, figuring out like how could you design your proteins that it sticks to another protein that a particular site because that's how you design drugs in the end. Um So you know, deep learning will be used for all of this. And those are kind of you know, would be sort of enormous progress if we could use it for that. Here's an example, if you take um this is like from recent material physics, you take a mono atomic layer of graphene, right? So it's just carbon on an exceptional mesh and then you make the single single atom thick, you put another one on top, you twist them by some magic Number of degrees, 3° or something. It becomes superconductor. Nobody has any idea

Speaker 1  02:48:39
why I want to know how that was discovered. But that's the kind of thing that machine learning can actually discover these things.

Speaker 2  02:48:47
Maybe not. But but there is a hint perhaps that with machine learning we will train a system to basically be a physiological model of some complex emergent phenomenon which, you know, superconductivity is one of those uh where you know, I think that this collective phenomenon is too difficult to describe from first principles with the current, you know, the usual sort of, you know, reductionist type method. But we could have deep learning systems that predict the properties of the system from a description of it after being trained with sufficient uh many samples um um this guy pascal fua cpfl, it has a startup company um that where he basically trained a condition that essentially to predict the aerodynamic properties of solids. And you can generate as much as you want by just running competition. Free dynamics. Right? So you give okay wing airfoil or something shape of some kind and you run competition. Free dynamics you get as a result the drag and you know, lift and all that stuff. Right. And you can you can generate lots of data to train a neural net to make those predictions. And now what you have is a differentiable model of, let's say a dragon and lift as a function of the shape of that solid. And so you can do background in the sand, you can optimize the shape so you get the properties you want.

Speaker 1  02:50:16
Um yeah, that's incredible. That's incredible. And on top of all that probably you should read a little bit of literature and a little bit of history for inspiration and for wisdom because after all, all of these technologies will have to work in the human world and the human world is complicated sadly. Yeah and this is um, an amazing conversation. I'm really honored that you talk with me today. Thank you for all the amazing work you're doing it fair at meta and thank you for being so passionate after all these years about everything that's going on, you're, you're a beacon of hope for the machine learning community and thank you so much for spending your valuable time with me today. That was awesome.

Speaker 2  02:50:57
Thanks for having me on. That was, it was a pleasure.
